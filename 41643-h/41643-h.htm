<h2 class="p3">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>No excuse need be offered to archers for presenting to them a
new edition of the late Mr. Horace A. Ford's work on the Theory
and Practice of Archery. It first appeared as a series of
articles in the columns of the 'Field,' which were republished
in book form in 1856; a second edition was published in
1859, which has been long out of print, and no book on the
subject has since appeared. Except, therefore, for a few copies
of this book, which from time to time may be obtained from
the secondhand booksellers, no guide is obtainable by which
the young archer can learn the principles of his art. On
hearing that it was in contemplation to reprint the second
edition of Mr. Ford's book, it seemed to me a pity that this
should be done without revision, and without bringing it up
to the level of the knowledge of the present day. I therefore
purchased the copyright of the work from Mr. Ford's representatives,
and succeeded in inducing Mr. Butt, who was for
many years the secretary of the Royal Toxophilite Society, to
undertake the revision.</p>

<p>A difficulty occurred at the outset as to the form in which
this revision should be carried out. If it had been possible,
there would have been advantages in printing Mr. Ford's text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
untouched, and in giving Mr. Butt's comments in the form of
notes. This course would, however, have involved printing
much matter that has become entirely obsolete, and, moreover,
not only would the bulk of the book have been increased to a
greater extent even than has actually been found necessary, but
also Mr. Butt's portion of the work, which contains the information
of the latest date, and is therefore of highest practical value
to young archers, would have been relegated to a secondary
and somewhat inconvenient position. Mr. Butt has therefore
rewritten the book, and it would hardly perhaps be giving him
too much credit to describe the present work as a Treatise on
the Theory and Practice of Archery by him, based on the work
of the late Horace A. Ford.</p>

<p>In writing his book, Mr. Ford committed to paper the
principles by means of which he secured his unrivalled position
as an archer. After displaying a clever trick, it is the
practice of some conjurers to pretend to take the spectators
into their confidence, and to show them 'how it is done.' In
such cases the audience, as a rule, is not much the wiser;
but a more satisfactory result has followed from Mr. Ford's
instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford was the founder of modern scientific archery.
First by example, and then by precept, he changed what before
was 'playing at bows and arrows' into a scientific pastime.
He held the Champion's medal for eleven years in succession&mdash;from
1849 to 1859. He also won it again in 1867. After
this time, although he was seen occasionally in the archery
field, his powers began to wane. He died in the year 1880.
His best scores, whether at public matches or in private practice,
have never been surpassed. But, although no one has
risen who can claim that on him has fallen the mantle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Mr. Ford, his work was not in vain. Thanks to the more scientific
and rational principles laid down by this great archer,
any active lad nowadays can, with a few months' practice,
make scores which would have been thought fabulous when
George III. was king.</p>

<p>The Annual Grand National Archery Meetings were started
in the year 1844 at York, and at the second meeting, in 1845,
held also at York, when the Double York Round was shot
for the first time, Mr. Muir obtained the championship, with
135 hits, and a score of 537. Several years elapsed before
the championship was won with a score of over 700. Nowadays,
a man who cannot make 700 is seldom in the first
ten, and, moreover, the general level both among ladies and
gentlemen continues to rise. We have not yet, however,
found any individual archer capable of beating in public the
marvellous record of 245 hits and 1,251 score, made by Mr.
Ford at Cheltenham in 1857.</p>

<p>One chief cause of the improvement Mr. Ford effected was
due to his recognising the fallacy in the time-honoured saying
that the archer should draw to the ear. When drawn to the
ear, part of the arrow must necessarily lie outside the direct
line of sight from the eye to the gold. Consequently, if the
arrow points apparently to the gold, it must fly to the left
of the target when loosed, and in order to hit the target, the
archer who draws to the ear must aim at some point to the
right. Mr. Ford laid down the principle that the arrow must
be drawn directly beneath the aiming eye, and lie in its whole
length in the same vertical plane as the line between the eye
and the object aimed at.</p>

<p>It is true that in many representations of ancient archers
the arrow is depicted as being drawn beyond the eye, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
consequently outside the line of sight. No doubt for war
purposes it was a matter of importance to shoot a long heavy
arrow, and if an arrow of a standard yard long or anything like
it was used, it would be necessary for a man to draw it beyond
his eye, unless he had very long arms indeed. But in war,
the force of the blow was of more importance than accuracy
of aim, and Mr. Ford saw that in a pastime where accuracy
of aim was the main object, this old rule no longer held good.
This was only one of many improvements effected by Mr. Ford;
but it is a fact that this discovery, which seems obvious enough
now that it is stated, was the main cause of the marvellous
improvement which has taken place in shooting.</p>

<p>The second chapter in Mr. Ford's book, entitled 'A Glance
at the Career of the English Long-Bow,' has been omitted. It
contained no original matter, being compiled chiefly from the
well-known works of Roberts, Moseley, and Hansard. The
scope of the present work is practical, not historical; and to
deal with the history of the English long-bow in a satisfactory
manner would require a bulky volume. An adequate history
of the bow in all ages and in all countries has yet to be
written.</p>

<p>In the chapters on the bow, the arrow, and the rest of the
paraphernalia of archery, much that Mr. Ford wrote, partly
as the result of the practice and experiments of himself and
others, and partly as drawn from the works of previous writers
on the subject, still holds good; but improvements have been
effected since his time, and Mr. Butt has been able to add a
great deal of useful information gathered from the long experience
of himself and his contemporaries.</p>

<p>The chapters which deal with Ascham's well-known five
points of archery&mdash;standing, nocking, drawing, holding, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
loosing&mdash;contain the most valuable part of Mr. Ford's teaching,
and Mr. Butt has endeavoured to develope further the principles
laid down by Mr. Ford. The chapters on ancient and
modern archery practice have been brought up to date, and
Mr. Butt has given in full the best scores made by ladies or
gentlemen at every public meeting which has been held since
the establishment of the Grand National Archery Society down
to 1886.</p>

<p>The chapter on Robin Hood has been omitted for the same
reasons which determined the omission of the chapter on the
career of the English long-bow, and the rules for the formation
of archery societies, which are cumbrous and old-fashioned,
have also been left out.</p>

<p>The <a href="#fisher">portrait</a> of Major C. H. Fisher, champion archer for the
years 1871-2-3-4, is reproduced from a photograph taken by
Mr. C. E. Nesham, the present holder of the champion's medal.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is hoped that the publication of this book
may help to increase the popularity of archery in this country.
It is a pastime which can never die out. The love of the bow
and arrow seems almost universally planted in the human
heart. But its popularity fluctuates, and though it is now
more popular than at some periods, it is by no means so universally
practised as archers would desire. One of its greatest
charms is that it is an exercise which is not confined to men.
Ladies have attained a great and increasing amount of skill
with the bow, and there is no doubt that it is more suited to
the fairer sex than some of the more violent forms of athletics
now popular. Archery has perhaps suffered to some extent
from comparison with the rifle. The rifleman may claim for
his weapon that its range is greater and that it shoots more
accurately than the bow. The first position may be granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
freely, the second only with reserve. Given, a well-made
weapon of Spanish or Italian yew, and arrows of the best
modern make, and the accuracy of the bow is measured only
by the skill of the shooter. If he can loose his arrow truly, it
will hit the mark; more than that can be said of no weapon.
That a rifleman will shoot more accurately at ranges well
within the power of the bow than an archer of similar skill is
certain; but the reason is that the bow is the more difficult,
and perhaps to some minds on that account the more fascinating,
weapon. The reason why it is more difficult is obvious,
and in stating it we see one of the many charms of archery.
The rifleman has but to aim straight and to hold steady, and
he will hit the bull's-eye. But the archer has also to supply
the motive force which propels his arrow. As he watches the
graceful flight of a well-shot shaft, he can feel a pride in its
swiftness and strength which a rifleman cannot share. And
few pastimes can furnish a more beautiful sight than an
arrow speeding swiftly and steadily from the bow, till with a
rapturous thud it strikes the gold at a hundred yards.</p>

<h2>ARCHERY</h2>

<h2 id="Page_1"><span class="subhead">CHAPTER I.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF THE ENGLISH LONG-BOW</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">Of the various implements of archery, the bow demands the
first consideration. It has at one period or another formed
one of the chief weapons of war and the chase in almost every
nation, and is, indeed, at the present day in use for both these
purposes in various parts of the world. It has differed as much
in form as in material, having been made curved, angular, and
straight; of wood, metal, horn, cane, whalebone, of wood and
horn, or of wood and the entrails and sinews of animals and
fish combined: sometimes of the rudest workmanship, sometimes
finished with the highest perfection of art.</p>

<p>No work exists which aims at giving an exhaustive description
of the various forms of bows which have been used by
different nations in ancient and modern times, and such an
undertaking would be far beyond the scope of the present
work. The only form of the bow with which we are now
concerned is the <i class="term">English long-bow</i>, and especially with the
English long-bow as now used for target-shooting as opposed
to the more powerful weapon used by our forefathers for the
purposes of war. The cross-bow never took a very strong
hold on the English nation as compared with the long-bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and, as it has never been much employed for recreation, it
need not be here described.</p>

<p>It is a matter of surprise and regret that so few genuine
specimens of the <i>old</i> English long-bow should remain in
existence at the present day. One in the possession of the
late Mr. Peter Muir of Edinburgh is said to have been used
in the battle of Flodden in 1513: it is of self-yew, a single
stave, apparently of English growth, and very roughly made.
Its strength has been supposed to be between 80 and 90 lbs.;
but as it could not be tested without great risk of breaking it,
its actual strength remains a matter of conjecture only. This
bow was presented to Mr. P. Muir by Colonel J. Ferguson, who
obtained it from a border house contiguous to Flodden Field,
where it had remained for many generations, with the reputation
of having been used at that battle.</p>

<p>There are likewise in the Tower two bows that were taken
out of the 'Mary Rose,' a vessel sunk in the reign of Henry
VIII. They are unfinished weapons, made out of single staves
of magnificent yew, probably of foreign growth, quite round
from end to end, tapered from the middle to each end, and
without horns. It is difficult to estimate their strength, but it
probably does not exceed from 65 to 70 lbs. Another weapon
now in the Museum of the United Service Institution came from
the same vessel. Probably the oldest specimen extant of the
English long-bow is in the possession of Mr. C. J. Longman.
It was dug out of the peat near Cambridge, and is unfortunately
in very bad condition. It can never have been a very
powerful weapon. Geologists say that it cannot be more recent
than the twelfth or thirteenth century, and may be much
more ancient. Indeed, from its appearance it is more probable
that it is a relic of the weaker archery of the Saxons
than that it is a weapon made after the Normans had introduced
their more robust shooting into this country.</p>

<p>Before the discussion of the practical points connected with
the bow is commenced, it must be borne in mind that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
pages profess to give the result of actual experience, and
nothing that is advanced is mere theory or opinion unsupported
by proof, but the result only of long, patient, and practical
investigation and of constant and untiring experiment.
Whenever, therefore, one kind of wood, or one shape of bow,
or one mode or principle of shooting, &amp;c., is spoken of as
being better than another, or the best of all, it is asserted to
be so simply because, after a full and fair trial of every other,
the result of such investigation bore out that assertion. No
doubt some of the points contended for were in Mr. Ford's
time in opposition to the then prevailing opinions and practice,
and were considered innovations. The value of theory,
however, is just in proportion as it can be borne out by practical
results; and in appealing to the success of his own practice
as a proof of the correctness of the opinions and principles
upon which it was based, he professed to be moved by no feeling
of conceit or vanity, but wholly and solely by a desire
to give as much force as possible to the recommendations put
forth, and to obtain a fair and impartial trial of them.</p>

<p>The English bows now in use may be divided primarily
into two classes&mdash;the <i class="term">self-bow</i> and the <i class="term">backed bow</i>; and, to
save space and confusion, the attention must first be confined
to the self-bow, reserving what has to be said respecting the
backed bow. Much, however, that is said of the one applies
equally to the other.</p>

<p>The self-bow of a single stave is the real old English
weapon&mdash;the one with which the mighty deeds that rendered
this country renowned in bygone times were performed; for
until the decline and disappearance of archery in war, as a
consequence of the superiority of firearms, and the consequent
cessation of the importation of bow-staves, backed bows were
unknown. Ascham, who wrote in the sixteenth century, when
archery had already degenerated into little else than an amusement,
mentions none other than self-bows; and it may therefore
be concluded that such only existed in his day. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
woods for self-bows, yew beyond all question carries off the
palm. Other woods have been, and still are, in use, such as
lance, cocus, Washaba, rose, snake, laburnum, and others; but
they may be summarily dismissed (with the exception of lance,
of which more hereafter) with the remark that self-bows made
of these woods are all so radically bad, heavy in hand, apt to
jar, dull in cast, liable to chrysal, and otherwise prone to break,
that no archer should use them so long as a self-yew or a good
backed bow is within reach.</p>

<p>The only wood, then, for self-bows is yew, and the best yew
is of foreign growth (Spanish or Italian), though occasionally
staves of English wood are met with which almost rival those
of foreign growth. This, however, is the exception; as a rule,
the foreign wood is the best: it is straighter, and finer in
grain, freer from pins, stiffer and denser in quality, and
requires less bulk in proportion to the strength of the bow.</p>

<p>The great bane of yew is its liability to knots and <i class="term">pins</i>,
and rare indeed it is to find a six-feet stave without one or
more of these undesirable companions. Where, however, a
pin occurs, it may easily be rendered comparatively harmless
by the simple plan of raising it&mdash;i.e. by leaving a little more
wood than elsewhere round the pin in the belly and back of the
bow. This strengthens the particular point, and diminishes
the danger of a chrysal or splinter. A pin resembles a small
piece of wire, is very hard and troublesome to the bowmaker's
tools, runs right through the bow-stave from belly
to back, and is very frequently the point at which a chrysal
starts. This chrysal (also called by old writers a 'pinch')
is a sort of disease which attacks the belly of a bow. At first
it nearly resembles a scratch or crack in the varnish. Its
direction is always diagonal to the line of the bow, and it
gradually eats deeply into the bow and makes it appear as
if it had been attacked with a chopper. If many small
chrysals appear, much danger need not be feared, though their
progress should be watched; but if one chrysal becomes deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
rooted, the bow should be sent to the bowmaker for a new
belly. A chrysal usually occurs in new bows, and mostly
arises from the wood being imperfectly seasoned; but it occasionally
will occur in a well-seasoned bow that has been lent
to a friend who uses a longer draw and dwells longer on
the point of aim, thus using the weapon beyond its wont.
Another danger to the life of a bow arises from splinters
in the back. These mostly occur in wet weather, when the
damp, through failure of the varnish, has been able to get
into the wood. Directly the rising of a splinter is observed,
that part of the bow should be effectually glued and wrapped
before it is again used. After this treatment the bow will be
none the worse, except in appearance. Yew and hickory only
should be used for the backs of bows. Canadian elm, which is
occasionally used for backs, is particularly liable to splinter. It
is obvious whenever a bow is broken the commencement of
the fracture has been in a splinter or a chrysal, according as
the first failure was in the back or the belly; therefore in the
diagnosis of these disorders archers have to be thankful for
small mercies. The grain of the wood should be as even and fine
as possible, with the feathers running quite straight, and as
nearly as possible consecutively from the handle to the horn
in each limb, and without curls; also, care should be taken, in
the manufacture of a bow, that the sap or back be of even
depth, and not in some places reduced to the level of the
belly. The feathering of a yew bow means the gradual disappearance
of some of the grain as the substance of the bow
is reduced between the handle and horn. A curl is caused
by a sudden turn in the grain of the wood, so that this feathering
is abruptly interrupted and reversed before it reappears.
This is a great source of weakness in a bow, both in belly and
back. There should be nothing of the nature of feathering
in the back of a bow, and it is believed that the best back is
that in which nothing but the bark has been removed from
the stave. Any interruption of the grain of the back is a source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of weakness and a hotbed of splinters. A bow that follows the
string should never be straightened, for the same reason that
anything of the nature of a carriage-spring should on no account
be reversed in application. The wood should be thoroughly
well seasoned and of a good sound hard quality. The finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and closest dark grain is undoubtedly the most beautiful and
uncommon; but the open or less close-grained wood, and
wood of paler complexion, are nearly, if not quite, as good for
use.</p>

<p>The self-yew bow may be a single-stave&mdash;that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
made of a single piece of wood, or may be made of two pieces
dovetailed or united in the handle by what is called a fish. In
a single-stave bow the quality of the wood will not be quite the
same in the two limbs, the wood of the lower growth being
denser than that of the upper; whilst in the grafted bow, made
of the same piece of wood, cut or split apart, and re-united in
the handle, the two limbs will be exactly of the same nature.
The joint, or <i class="term">fishing</i> (fig. 7), should be double, not single. The
difference, however, between these two sorts of self-yew bows is so
slight as to be immaterial. In any unusually damp or variable
climate single staves should be prepared; and in the grafted
bows care should be taken in ascertaining that they be firmly
put together in the middle. A single-stave bow has usually a
somewhat shorter handle, as it becomes unnecessary to cover
so much of the centre of the bow when the covering is not
used as a cover to the joint, but for the purpose of holding the
bow only.</p>

<p>In shape all bows should be full and inflexible in the centre,
tapering gradually to each horn. They should never bend
in the handle, as bows of this shape (i.e. a continuous curve
from horn to horn) always jar most disagreeably in the hand.
A perfectly graduated bend, from a stiff unbending centre of
at least nine inches, towards each horn is the best. Some
self-yew bows are naturally reflexed, others are straight, and
some follow the string more or less. The slightly reflexed bows
are perhaps more pleasing to the eye, as one cannot quite
shake off the belief that the shape of Cupid's bow is agreeable.
Bows which follow the string somewhat are perhaps the most
pleasant to use.</p>

<p>The handle of the bow, which in size should be regulated
to the grasp of each archer, should be in such a position that
the upper part of it may be from an inch to an inch and a
quarter above the <i class="term">true centre</i> of the bow, or the point in the
handle whereon the bow will balance. If this centre be lower
down in the handle, as is usual in bows of Scotch manufacture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the cast of the bow may be somewhat improved, but at the
cost of a tendency to that unpleasant feeling of kicking and
jarring in the hand. Again, if the true centre be higher, or,
as is the case in the old unaltered Flemish bows, at the point
where the arrow lies on the hand, the cast will be found to
suffer disadvantageously. If the handle be properly grasped
(inattention to which will endanger the bow's being pulled out
of shape), the fulcrum, in drawing, will be about the true
balancing centre, and the root of the thumb will be placed
thereon. Considering a bow to consist of three members&mdash;a
handle and two limbs&mdash;the upper limb, being somewhat longer,
must of necessity bend a trifle more, and this it should do.
The most usual covering for the handle is plush; but woollen
binding-cloth, leather, and india-rubber are also in constant
use.</p>

<p>The piece of mother-of-pearl, ivory, or other hard substance
usually inserted in the handle of the bow, at the point
where the arrow lies, is intended to prevent the wearing away
of the bow by the friction of the arrow; but this precaution
overreaches itself, as in the course of an unusually long life
the most hard-working bow will scarcely lose as much by
this friction as must, to start with, be cut away for this
insertion.</p>

<p>The length of the bow, which is calculated from nock to
nock&mdash;and this length will vary a little from the actual length,
according as it may be said to hold itself upright or stoop,
i.e. follow the string&mdash;should be regulated by its strength and
the length of the arrow to be used with it. It may be taken
as a safe rule that the stronger the bow the greater its length
should be; and so also the longer the arrow the longer should
be the bow. For those who use arrows of the usual length of
from 27 to 28 inches, with bows of the strength of from 45 lbs.
to 55 lbs., a useful and safe length will be not less than
5 ft. 10 in. If this length of arrow or weight of bow be increased
or diminished, the length of bow may be proportionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
increased or diminished, taking as the two extremes 5 ft. 8 in.
and 6 feet. No bow need be much outside either of these
measurements. It may be admitted that a short bow will
cast somewhat farther than a longer one of the same weight,
but this extra cast can only be gained by a greater risk of
breakage. As bows are usually weighed and marked by the
bowmakers for a 28-inch arrow fully drawn up, a greater or
less pull will take more or less out of them, and the archer's
calculations must be made accordingly.</p>

<p>To increase or diminish the power of a bow, it is usual to
shorten it in the former case, and to reduce the bulk in the latter;
but to shorten a bow will probably shorten its life too, and
mayhap spoil it, unless it be certain that it is superfluously long
or sufficiently strong in the handle. On the other hand, to
reduce a bow judiciously, if it need to be weaker, can do it no
harm; but the reduction should not be carried quite up to the
handle. It is a good plan to choose a bow by quality, regardless
of strength, and have the best bow that can be procured reduced
to the strength suitable. In all cases the horns should
be well and truly set on, and the nocks should be of sufficient
bulk to enclose safely the extremities of the limbs of the bow
running up into them, and the edges of the nocks should be
made most carefully smooth. If the edge of the nock be
sharp and rough, the string must be frayed, and in consequence
break sooner or later, and endanger the safety of the bow.
The lower nock is not unfrequently put on or manufactured a
trifle sideways as to its groove on the belly side. This is done
with a view to compensate the irregularity of the loop: but this
is a mistake, as it is quite unnecessary in the case of a loop, and
must be liable to put the string out of position when there is
a second eye to the string&mdash;and this second eye every archer
who pays due regard to the preservation of his bows and
strings should be most anxious to adopt as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From all that can be learned respecting the backed bow,
it would appear that its use was not adopted in this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
until archery was in its last stage of decline as a weapon of
war, when, the bow degenerating into an instrument of amusement,
the laws relating to the importation of yew staves from
foreign countries were evaded, and the supply consequently
ceased. It was then that the bowyers hit upon the plan of
uniting a tough to an elastic wood, and so managed to make
a very efficient weapon out of very inferior materials. This
cannot fairly be claimed as an invention of the English
bowyers, but is an adaptation of the plan which had long
been in use amongst the Turks, Persians, Tartars, Chinese,
and many other nations, including Laplanders, whose bows
were made of two pieces of wood united with isinglass. As
far as regards the English backed bow (this child of necessity),
the end of the sixteenth century is given as the period of its
introduction, and the Kensals of Manchester are named as
the first makers&mdash;bows of whose make may be still in existence
and use&mdash;and these were generally made of yew backed with
hickory or wych-elm. At the time of the revival of archery&mdash;at
the close of the last century, and again fifty years ago&mdash;all
backed bows were held in great contempt by any that could
afford self-yews, and were always slightingly spoken of as 'tea-caddy'
bows; meaning that they were made of materials fit
for nothing but ornamental joinery, Tunbridge ware, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The backed bows of the present day are made of two or
more strips of the same or different woods securely glued, and
compressed together as firmly as possible, in frames fitted with
powerful screws, which frames are capable of being set to any
shape. Various woods are used, most of which, though of different
quality, make serviceable bows. For the backs we have
the sap of yew, hickory, American, Canadian, or wych-elm,
hornbeam, &amp;c.; and for the bellies, yew, lance, fustic, snake,
Washaba, and letter-wood, which is the straight grained part of
snake, and some others. Of all these combinations Mr. Ford
gave the strongest preference to bows of yew backed with yew.
These he considered the only possible rivals of the self-yew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Next in rank he classed bows of yew backed with hickory.
Bows made of lance backed with hickory, when the woods used
are well seasoned and of choice quality, are very steady and
trustworthy, but not silky and pleasant in drawing like bows
made of yew. One advantage of this combination of bow is
that both these woods can be had of sufficient length to avoid
the trouble in making and insecurity in use of the joint in the
handle. Of bows into which more than two woods are introduced,
the combination of yew for the belly, fustic or other
good hard wood for the centre, and hickory for the back cannot
well be improved upon, and such bows have been credited
with excellent scores. There is also a three-wooded modification
of the lance and hickory bow. In this a tapering strip of
hard wood is introduced between the back and belly; this strip
passes through the handle and disappears at about a foot
from the horn in each limb. The lancewood bows are the
cheapest, and next to these follow the lance-and-hickory bows,
and then those of the description last mentioned. On this
account beginners who do not wish to go to much expense
whilst they are, as it were, testing their capacity for the
successful prosecution of this sport, would do well to make a
start with a bow of one or other of these descriptions. It
will often be useful to lend to another beginner, or to a friend,
to whom it might not be wise to lend a more valuable bow; or
it may even be of use to the owner at a pinch. Bows have
often been made of many more than three pieces; but nothing
is gained by further complications, unless it be necessary in
the way of repair.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the consideration of the material of
which backed bows should be made comes the treatment of
their shape. Judging from such specimens of backed bows,
made by Waring and others, before the publication of Mr. H. A.
Ford's articles on archery in the 'Field,' as have survived to the
present day, and whose survival may be chiefly attributed to
the fact that they were so utterly harsh and disagreeable in use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that it was but little use they ever got, the author was probably
right in saying that they all bent in the handle more or
less when drawn, and were too much reflexed. There is but
little doubt that&mdash;as the joint in the handle, necessitating extra
bulk and strength, could be dispensed with in these bows&mdash;the
makers considered it an excellent opportunity to give their
goods what (however erroneously) was then considered the best
shape (when drawn), namely, the perfect arc; and this harmonious
shape they obtained most successfully by making
the bows comparatively weak in the handle and unnecessarily
strong towards the horns; with the result that these 'tea-caddy
bows' met the contemptuous fate they well deserved.
Modern archers have to be thankful to Mr. Ford for the vast
improvement in backed bows (even more than in the case of
self-bows), which are now perfectly steady in hand, and taper
gradually, and as much as is compatible with the safety of the
limbs, and this in spite of their being still made somewhat
more reflex when new than appears necessary in the manufacture
of self-yew bows. Yet Mr. Ford was perfectly right to
condemn all reflexity that does not result in a bow becoming
either straight or somewhat to follow the string after it has
been in use sufficiently long for its necessary training to its
owner's style. The first quality of a bow is steadiness. Now
this quality is put in peril either by a want of exact balance
between the two limbs&mdash;when the recoil of one limb is quicker
than that of the other&mdash;or by undue reflexity. These causes
of unsteadiness occur in self-bows as well as in backed bows,
and are felt in the shape of a jar or kick in the hand when
loosed. This unsteadiness from want of balance in the limbs
may be cured by a visit of the bow to the maker for such
fresh tillering (as it is called) as will correct the fault of one
or other limb. If the unsteadiness arise from excessive reflexity,
which cannot be reduced by use, a further tapering
of the limbs must be adopted. No bow of any sort that
cannot be completely cured of kicking should be kept, as no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
steady shooting can be expected from such a bow. A bow
that is much reflexed will be more liable to chrysals and
splinters, as the belly has to be more compressed and the back
more strained than in a bow of proper shape; also, such a bow
is much more destructive to strings, as a greater strain is put
upon the strings by the recoil of the limbs than is the case with
a bow that follows the string or bends inwards naturally. It
is the uneven or excessive strain upon the string after the discharge
of the arrow that causes the kicking of the bow.</p>

<p>When the question arises, 'Which is the best sort of bow?'
it is found that the solution has only been rendered more
complicated since 1859 by the great improvement in the
manufacture of various sorts of backed bows: as the following
remarks, then applied to the comparison between the self-yew
and the yew-backed yew only, must now be extended to all
the best specimens of backed bows of different sorts. The
advocates of the self-yew affirm that good specimens of their
pet weapon are the sweetest in use, the steadiest in hand, the
most certain in cast, and the most beautiful to the eye; and
in all these points, with the exception of certainty of cast,
they are borne out by the fact. This being the state of the
case, how is it, then, that a doubt can still remain as to which
it is most profitable for an archer to use? Here are three
out of four points (two of which are most important) in
which it is admitted that the self-yew is superior; and yet,
after much practical and experimental testing of all sorts, it
must be left to the taste and judgment of each man to decide
for himself. The fact undoubtedly is, that the self-yew is the
most perfect weapon. But it is equally an undoubted fact
that it requires more delicate handling; since, its cast lying
very much in the last three or four inches of its pull, any
variation in this respect, or difference in quickness or otherwise
of loose, varies the elevation of the arrow to a much greater
extent than the same variation of pull or loose in the others,
whose cast is more uniform throughout. Now, were a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
perfect in his physical powers, or always in first-rate shooting
condition, there would be no doubt as to which bow he should
use, as he would in this case be able to attain to the difficult
nicety required in the management of the self-yew; but as
this constant perfection never can be maintained, the superior
merits of this bow are partially counteracted by the extreme
difficulty of doing justice to them; and the degree of harshness
of pull and unsteadiness in hand of the others being but
trifling, the greater certainty with which they accomplish the
elevation counterbalances, upon average results, their inferiority
in other respects. Another advantage the self-yew possesses
is, that it is not so liable to injury from damp as are the
backed bows; but then the latter are much less costly, and,
with common care, need cause no fear of harm from damp,
as an inch of lapping at either end covering the junction with
the horns will preserve them from this danger. As regards
chrysals, and breakage from other causes than damp, bows of all
sorts of wood are about equally liable to failure. The main
results of the comparison, then, resolve themselves into these
two prominent features: namely, that the self-yew bow, from
its steadiness, sweetness, and absence of vibration, ensures
the straightness of the shot better than backed bows; whilst
the latter, owing to the regularity of their cast not being
confined quite to a hair's breadth of pull, carry off the palm
for greater certainty in the elevation of the shot.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to say that there are bad bows
of all sorts, many being made of materials that are fit for
nothing but firewood; and yet the bowmakers seem to be
almost justified in making up such materials by the fact that
occasionally the most ungainly bow will prove itself almost
invaluable in use, while a perfect beauty in appearance may
turn out a useless slug.</p>

<p>Though it may be no easy matter to decide which
particular sort of bow an individual archer should adopt, yet,
when that individual has once ascertained the description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
bow that appears to suit him best, he will be wise to confine
his attention to that same sort in his future acquisition of
bows. An archer who shoots much will find his bowmaker's
account a serious annual matter if he keep none but the best
self-yew bows; and therefore any who find it necessary to
count the cost of this sport should do their best to adapt
themselves to the cheaper though not much inferior backed
bows. This also may be further said of the difference between
self-yews and backed bows&mdash;namely, that there appears to be
a sort of individuality attached to each self-yew bow, apart
from the peculiarities of its class, which makes it difficult
(not regarding the cost) to remedy the loss of a favourite self-yew
bow. It is very much easier to replace any specimen of
the other sorts of bows, as there is much less variation of
character in each class.</p>

<p>The 'carriage bow' is made to divide into two pieces by
means of a metal socket in the handle, after the fashion of the
joint of a fishing-rod. The object of this make of bow is to
render it more convenient as a travelling-companion; but, as
the result is a bow heavy in hand and unpleasant in use, the
remedy appears to be worse than the disease.</p>

<p>It is often asserted that the best bows should be made of
steel, as superior in elasticity to wood; but this is not borne
out by the results of experiment. The late Hon. R. Hely-Hutchinson,
a member of the R. Tox. Soc., took a great deal of
pains to have long-bows manufactured of steel both in England
and in Belgium. The best of these, weighing about 50 lbs.
for the 28-inch draw, with the aim and elevation which with
a good wooden bow would carry an arrow 100 yards, scarcely
carried its shaft as far as 60 yards, so deadly slow appeared
the recoil; and besides this, the actual weight in the hand of
the implement was so considerable that it would be a most
serious addition to the toil of the day, on account of its being
so frequently held out at arm's length, to say nothing of its
having to be carried about all day.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER II.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>HOW TO CHOOSE A BOW, AND HOW TO USE AND
PRESERVE IT WHEN CHOSEN</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The next point to be considered is the strength of the bow
to be chosen; and respecting this, in the first place, the bow
must be completely under the shooter's command&mdash;within it,
but not much below it. One of the greatest mistakes young
archers (and many old ones too) commit is that they <i>will</i> use
bows that are too strong for them. In fact, there are but few
to whom, at one or other period of their archery career, this
remark has not applied. The desire to be considered strong
appears to be the moving agent to this curious hallucination; as
if a man did not rather expose his weakness by straining at a
bow evidently beyond his strength, thereby calling attention
to that weakness, than by using a lighter one with grace and
ease, which always give the idea of force, vigour, and power.
Another incentive to the use of strong bows is the passion for
sending down the arrows sharp and low, and the consequent
employment of powerful bows to accomplish this; the which
is perhaps a greater mistake than the other, for it is not so
much the strength of the bow as the perfect command of it
that enables the archer to obtain this desideratum. The question
is not so much what a man can pull as what he can
loose; and he will without doubt obtain a lower flight of
arrow by a lighter power of bow under his command, than he
will by a stronger one beyond his proper management. This
mania for strong bows has destroyed many a promising archer,
in an archery sense of the term. Not only did one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the best shots of his day, a winner of the second and first
prizes at successive Grand National Meetings, dwindle beneath
mediocrity in accuracy through this infatuation, but another
brought himself to death's door by a dangerous illness of
about a year's duration, by injury to his physical powers,
brought on by the same failing, only carried to a much greater
excess. And, after all, the thing so desired is not always thus
attained.</p>

<p>Let the reader attend any Grand National Archery Meeting,
and let him observe some fifty or so picked shots of the country
arranged at the targets, and contending with all their might
for the prizes of honour and skill. Whose arrows fly down the
sharpest, steadiest, and keenest? Are they those of the archers
who use the strongest bows? Not at all. Behold that archer
from an Eastern county just stepping so unpretendingly forward
to deliver his shafts. See! with what grace and ease
the whole thing is done!&mdash;no straining, no contortions there!
Mark the flight of his arrows&mdash;how keen, and low, and to
the mark they fly! None fly sharper, few so sharp. And
what is the strength of that beautiful self-yew bow which he
holds in his hand? Scarce 50 lbs.! And yet the pace of his
shaft is unsurpassed by any; and it is close upon five shillings
in weight too. There is another. Mark his strength and
muscular power! Possibly a bow of 80 lbs. would be within
his pull; yet he knows better than to use any such, when the
prizes are awarded to skill, not brute force. The bow he employs
is but 48 lbs.; yet how steady and true is the flight of
his arrow! And so on all through the meeting: it will be
found that it is not the strongest bows, but those that are
under the perfect command of their owners, that do their work
the best.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, then, as the proper flight of an arrow from any
bow depends almost entirely upon the way in which it is loosed,
the strength of the bow must not be regulated by the mere
muscular powers of the individual archer; for he may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to draw even a 29-inch arrow to the head in a very powerful
bow without being able during a match to loose steadily a bow
of more than 50 lbs. Not the power of drawing, but of loosing
steadily, must therefore be the guide here. The bow must be
within this loosing power, but also well up to it; for it is
almost as bad to be <i class="term">under</i>- as <i class="term">over</i>-bowed. The evils attendant
upon being over-bowed are various: the left (bow) arm,
wrist, and elbow, the fingers of the right (loosing) hand and
its wrist, are strained and rendered unsteady; the pull becomes
uncertain and wavering, and is never twice alike; the
whole system is overworked and wearied; and, besides this,
the mind is depressed by ill-success; the entire result is disappointment
and failure. On the other hand, care must be
taken not to fall into the opposite extreme of being under-bowed,
as in this case the loose becomes difficult, and generally
unsteady and unequal. The weight of the bows now in general
use varies from 45 lbs. to 54 lbs., stronger ones forming
the exception; and the lowest of these weights is ample for
the distances now usually shot. Each archer must therefore
find out how much he can draw with ease and loose with
steadiness throughout a day's shooting, and choose accordingly.
If a beginner, 50 lbs. is probably the outside weight with which
he should commence; a few pounds less, in most cases, would
even be better for the starting-point. As lately as twenty years
ago bows were very carelessly marked in the indication of
their strength, many bows being marked as much as 10 lbs.
above their actual measure; but in the present day all the
bowmakers incline towards the custom of marking a new bow
to weigh rather less, perhaps by 3 lbs., than its actual weight.
The reason of this is that in the opinion of the marker the bow
will arrive at the strength marked in the course of use. It is
indeed a very rare case when a new bow does not with use get
somewhat weaker.</p>

<p>Besides keeping the bows for his own use mostly of the
same description, every archer should also keep them of just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
about the same weight; and if he shoot much he should
possess at the fewest three, as much alike as possible, and
use them alternately. This will prove an economy in the
end, as each will have time to recover its elasticity, and will
thus last a much longer time. It is an agreeable feature in
bows that they have considerable facility in recovery from the
effects of hard work. This fact may be easily tested by weighing
a bow on a steelyard before and after shooting a single
York round with it, when a difference of one pound or more will
be found in the strength of it, more particularly if the day be
hot; but with a few days' rest this lost power will be regained
by the bow.</p>

<p>In the choice of a bow a beginner should secure the assistance
of an experienced friend, or content himself with an unambitious
investment in a cheap specimen of backed-bow or
a self-lance, on which he may safely expend his inexperience.
When an archer is sufficiently advanced to know the sort and
weight of bow that best suits him, let him go to the maker he
prefers, and name the price he can afford to give&mdash;the prices
of trustworthy self-yews vary from twenty to five guineas,
of yew-backed yews from five to three guineas, and of other
backed bows from three guineas to thirty shillings; whilst self-lance
bows may be procured for as little as twelve shillings&mdash;and
he will soon find what choice there is for him. If there
appears one likely to suit, let him first examine the bow to see
that there be no <i class="term">knots</i>, <i class="term">curls</i>, <i class="term">pins</i>, <i class="term">splinters</i>, <i class="term">chrysals</i>, or other
objectionable flaws; then let him string it, and, placing the
lower end on the ground in such a position that the whole of the
string shall be under his eye and uppermost, let him notice
whether the bow be perfectly straight. If it be so, the bow, so
balanced between the ground at the lower and a finger at the
upper end, will appear symmetrically divided by the string
into two parts. Should there appear to be more on one side
of the string than on the other in either limb, the bow is not
straight, and should be rejected. A bow is said to have a <i class="term">cast</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
when it is tilted in its back out of the perpendicular to the
plane passing through the string and the longitudinal centre
of the bow. Any bow that has this fault should also be
rejected. This fault, if it should happen to exist, will be
easily detected by reversing the position of the bow just
previously described, i.e. by holding the bow as before, but
with the back upwards. The next step is to watch the bow as it
is drawn up, so as to be able to judge whether it bend evenly
in both its limbs and show no sign of weakness in any
particular point. The upper limb, as before stated, being the
longest, should appear to bend a trifle the most, so that the
whole may be symmetrical, when considered as bending from
the real centre. It may next be tested, to ascertain whether
it be a kicker; thus the string must be drawn up six inches or
so and then loosed (of course without an arrow). If the bow
have the fault of kicking ever so little, experience will easily
detect it by the jolt in the hand. But on no account in this
experiment should the string (without an arrow) be fully drawn
and loosed. Care should be taken that the bow be sufficiently
long for its strength. What has hitherto been said applies
to all bows; but in self-bows attention must be paid to the
straightness of the feathering of the wood. As a general rule,
the lightest wood in a yew-bow will have the quickest cast,
and the heaviest will make the most lasting implement. Between
two bows of the same strength and length, the one
being slight and the other bulky, there will be about the
same difference as between a thoroughbred and a cart-horse.
Therefore the preference should be given to bows that are
light and slight for their strength. Light-coloured and dark
yew make equally good bows, though most prefer the dark
colour for choice. Fine and more open grain in yew are also
equally good, but the finer is more scarce. If there be no
bow suitable&mdash;i.e. none of the right weight&mdash;let the choice fall
upon the best bow of greater power, and let it be reduced.
Failing this, the purchaser may select an unfinished stave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and have it made to his own pattern; but it is not easy to
foretell how a stave will make up.</p>

<p>There remains one point about a bow, hitherto unnoticed,
and this is its section, as to shape. This may vary, being broad
and flat across its back, or the contrary&mdash;deep and pointed
in the belly. Here again extremes should be avoided&mdash;the
bow should in shape be neither too flat nor too deep. If it be
an inch or so across the back just above the handle, it should
also have about the same measurement through from back to
belly. This much being granted, it is further declared that
the back should be almost as flat and angular as possible,
showing that it has been reduced as little as may be after
the removal of the bark; but the belly should be rounded;
and as the back should not be reduced in its depth towards
the horns, and should not get too narrow across, it will follow
that the chief reduction, to arrive at the proper curvature
when the bow is drawn, must be in the belly, and therefore
towards the horn. A well-shaped bow will in measurement
become somewhat shallower from back to belly than it is across
the back as it advances towards the horns.</p>

<p>Bows are broken from several causes: by means of neglected
chrysals in the belly, or splinters in the back; by a
jerking, uneven, or crooked style of drawing; by dwelling over-long
on the point of aim after the arrow is fully drawn; by
the breaking of the string; by damp, and oftentimes by carelessness;
and even by thoughtlessness. Bows, moreover, may be
broken on the steelyard in the weighing of them. A few years
ago, when the Americans first took up archery very keenly,
one of their novices wrote to a prominent English archer
saying that he had broken nearly seventy bows in a couple of
years, and asking the reason. He was told that he must either
keep his bows in a damp place or the bows must be very bad
ones, or else (to which view the writer inclined) he must be
in the habit of stringing them the reverse way with the belly
outwards. This would certainly have a fatal effect, but it is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that the Americans bought a number of very bad bows about
that time from inferior makers in England. Whenever chrysals
appear they must be carefully watched, and, as has already
been said, if they become serious, a new belly must be added.
This will not be a serious disfigurement, even to a self-yew bow.
A splinter should be glued and lapped at once, but no one
nowadays seems to care to have the covering patch painted
as formerly, to represent as nearly as possible the colours of
the different parts of the bow. Care should be taken not to
stab the belly of the bow with the point of the arrow when
nocking it; and the dents in the back of the bow made with
the arrow as it is carelessly pulled out of the target should
be avoided. A glove-button will often injure the back of the
bow whilst it is being strung. As other ornaments&mdash;buttons,
buckles, &amp;c.&mdash;may also inflict disfigurements, it is better to
avoid their presence as far as possible. Breakages from a bad
style of drawing, or from dwelling too long on the aim, can
only be avoided by adopting a better and more rational method.
In order to avoid fracture through the breaking of strings,
any string that shows signs of failure from too much wear or
otherwise should be discarded; and strings that are too stiff,
too hard, and too thin should be avoided. If a string break
when the arrow is fully or almost drawn, there is but little
hope for the bow; but if it break in the recoil after the arrow
is shot, which fortunately is more frequently the case, the
bow will seldom suffer. Yet if after the bow is strung the
archer should observe that the string is no longer trustworthy,
and decide to discard it, he should on no account cut it whilst
the bow is braced, as the result of so doing will be an almost
certain fracture. If the string be looped at both ends and
the loop at either end be made too large, so that it slip off
the nock in stringing, the bow may break, so that an archer
who makes his own loops at the lower end of the string must
be careful not to make them too loose. Breakage from damp
is little to be feared in self-bows, except in localities where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is exceptionally moist, or, after long neglect, when damp has
taken possession of the joint in the handle. In these cases
single staves only are safe. Amongst backed bows there is
much mortality from this cause. Commonly, it will be the
lower limb that will fail, as that is most exposed to damp,
arising either from the ground whilst shooting, or from the
floor when put away. If the bow has been used in damp
weather it should be carefully dried and rubbed with waxed
flannel or cloth. A waterproof case, an 'Ascham' raised an
inch or so above the floor in a dry room, and the bow hung up,
not resting on its lower horn, are the best-known precautions.
Half an inch of lapping, glued and varnished, above and below
the joint of the horn is also a safe precaution against damp;
also an occasional narrow lap in the course of the limb will
assist to 'fast bind, fast find.' As regards the danger of carelessness,
bows have been broken through attempts to string
them the wrong way, or by using them upside down; and
thoughtlessness will lead the inexperienced to attempt to bring
a bow that follows the string upright, to its infinite peril. In
such cases the verdict of 'Serve him right' should be brought
against the offender if he be the owner. In weighing a bow
on the steelyard care must be taken to see that the peg indicating
the length to be drawn be at the right point; otherwise a
lady's bow, for instance, may be destroyed in the mistaken
attempt to pull it up twenty-eight inches, or three inches too
much.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that a belly much injured by
chrysals may be replaced by a new belly; any incurable failure
of the back may also be cured by its renewal. A weak bow or
limb may also be strengthened by these means. Also, if either
limb be broken or irretrievably damaged, and the remaining
one be sound, and worth the expense, another limb may be
successfully grafted on to the old one. If possible, let this be
an old limb also, as the combination of new and old wood
is not always satisfactory; the former (though well seasoned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
being unseasoned by use), being more yielding, is apt after a
little use to lose its relative strength, and so spoil the proper
balance of the bow. This grafting of one broken limb upon
another may be carried to the length of grafting together two
limbs of different sorts. Mr. P. Muir, who was as good a
bowyer as he was an accurate shot, had a favourite bow, that
did him good service in 1865 at Clifton, when he took the
third place at the Grand National Archery Meeting. This bow
in one limb was yew-backed yew, and in the other lance backed
with hickory. A bow that is weak in the centre, and not
sufficiently strong to allow of the ends being further reduced,
may be brought to the required shape, and strengthened by
the addition of a short belly.</p>

<p>With regard to unstringing the bow during the shooting,
say, of a York Round of 144 arrows, at the three distances, a
good bow will not need it, if the shooting be moderately quick,
excepting at the end of each of the distances. If there happen
to be many shooters, or very slow ones, it may be unstrung
after every three or four double ends; and of course it should
be unstrung whenever an interruption of the shooting may
occur from rain, or any other cause; but it certainly appears
unnecessary to unstring the bow after each three shots, as
this is an equally uncalled-for strain upon the muscles of the
archer and relief to the grain of the wood. In a discussion on
this subject, however, between Mr. James Spedding and Mr.
P. Muir, the latter maintained that to be unstrung at each
end was as agreeable to the bow as to rest on a camp-stool
was to the archer. Some archers contend that it is better to
have the bow strung some few minutes before the commencement
of the shooting.</p>

<p>All that has been said respecting men's bows, with the
exception of strength and length, applies equally to those used
by ladies. The usual strength of these latter varies from 24 lbs.
to 30 lbs. In length they should not be less than five feet.
The usual length of a lady's arrow being twenty-five inches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whilst that of a gentleman is twenty-eight inches, it appears
that, when fully drawn, a lady's bow must be bent more in
proportion to its length than that of a gentleman. The proportion
between the bows being as 5 to 6, whilst that of the
arrows is as 6-1/4 to 7; yet ladies' bows appear to be quite capable
of bearing this extra strain safely.</p>

<p>As bows of three pieces are seldom to be met with
manufactured for the use of ladies, their choice of weapons
is limited to self-yews, yew-backed yews, yew backed with
hickory, and lance backed with hickory; also self-lance bows for
beginners, &amp;c. Ladies' bows of snake and other hard woods
are still to be met with; but they are so vastly inferior to
those above-mentioned that it is scarcely necessary to refer to
them.</p>

<p>It is too common a practice amongst archers to throw the
consequences of their own faults upon the bowmakers, accusing
the weapon of being the cause of their failures, instead
of blaming their own carelessness or want of skill. But, before
this can be justly done, let each be quite certain that he has
chosen his bow with care, and kept it with care; if otherwise,
any accidents occurring are, ten to one, more likely to be the
result of his own fault than that of the bowmaker.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER III.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF THE ARROW</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The arrow is perhaps the most important of all the implements
of the archer, and requires the greatest nicety of make
and excellence of materials; for, though he may get on without
absolute failure with an inferior bow or other tackle, unless
the arrow be of the best Robin Hood himself would have aimed
in vain. Two things are essential to a good arrow, namely,
perfect straightness, and a stiffness or rigidity sufficient to
stand in the bow, i.e. to receive the force of the bow as
delivered by the string without flirting or gadding; for a weak
or supple is even worse than a crooked arrow&mdash;and it need
hardly be said how little conducive to shooting straight is the
latter. The straightness of the arrow is easily tested by the
following simple process. Place the extremities of the nails
of the thumb and middle finger of the left hand so as just to
touch each other, and with the thumb and same finger of the
right hand spin the arrow upon the nails at about the arrow's
balancing-point; if it revolve truly and steadily, keeping in
close and smooth contact with the nails, it is straight; but if it
jump in the very least the contrary is the case. In order to
test its strength or stiffness the arrow must be held by the
nock, with its pile placed on some solid substance. The hand
at liberty should now be pressed downwards on the middle of
the arrow. A very little experience as to whether the arrow
offer efficient resistance to this pressure will suffice to satisfy the
archer about its stiffness. An arrow that is weaker on one side
than on the other should also be rejected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Arrows are either <i class="term">selfs</i> or <i class="term">footed</i>; the former being made
of a single piece of wood (these are now seldom in use, except
for children), and the latter have a piece of different and
harder wood joined on to them at the pile end. 'A shaft,'
says old Roger Ascham,' hath three principal parts&mdash;the <i class="term">stele</i>,
the <i class="term">feather</i>, and the <i class="term">head</i>.' The stele, or wooden body of the
arrow, used to be, and still is occasionally, made of different
sorts of wood; but for target use, and indeed for any other
description of modern shooting, all may be now discarded save
one&mdash;red deal, which when clean, straight of grain, and well
seasoned, whether for selfs or footed shafts, is incomparably
superior to all others. For the footing any hard wood will
do; and if this be solid for one inch below the pile it will be
amply sufficient. Lance and Washaba are perhaps the best
woods for this purpose; the latter is the toughest, but the
former Mr. Ford preferred, as he thought the darkness of the
Washaba had a tendency to attract the eye. The darker
woods, however, are now mostly in use. This footing has
three recommendations: the first, that it enables the arrow to
fly more steadily and get through the wind better; the second,
that, being of a substance harder than deal, it is not so easily
worn by the friction it unavoidably meets with on entering the
target or the ground; and the third, that this same hardness
saves the point from being broken off should it happen to strike
against any hard substance&mdash;such, for instance, as a stone in
the ground or the iron leg of a target-stand. Before the shooting
is commenced, and after it is finished, the arrows should
be rubbed with a piece of oiled flannel. This will prevent
the paint of the target from adhering to them. If in spite
of this precaution any paint should adhere to them, sandpaper
should on no account be used to clean them: this is
most objectionable, as it will wear away the wood of the
footing. Turpentine should be applied, or the blunt back of
a knife.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the subject of the best shape for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
'stele' of the arrow for practical use, it is necessary to say a
few words upon a point where the theory and practice of
archery apparently clash.</p>

<p>If the arrow be placed on the bowstring as if for shooting,
the bow drawn, and an aim taken at an object, and if the bow
be then slowly relaxed, the arrow being held until it returns
to the position of rest&mdash;i.e. if the passage of the arrow over
the bow be slow and gradual&mdash;it will be found, if the bow be
held quite firmly during this action, that the arrow does not
finally point to the object aimed at, but in a direction deviating
considerably to the left of it&mdash;in fact, that its direction has
been constantly deviating more and more from the point of
aim at each point during its return to the position of rest.
This is, of course, due to the half-breadth of the bow, the
nock of the arrow being carried on the string, in a plane
passing through the string and the axis of the bow's length;
and this deviation will be greater if the arrow be chested (i.e.
slighter at the pile than at the nock), and less if it be bobtailed
(i.e. slighter at the nock than at the pile) than if the arrow
be cylindrical throughout. If the same arrow, when drawn
to the head, be loosed at the object aimed at&mdash;i.e. if the
passage of the arrow over the bow be impulsive and instantaneous&mdash;it
will go straight to the object aimed at, the shooting
being in all respects perfect.</p>

<p>How, then, is the difference of the final direction of the
arrow in the two cases to be explained?</p>

<p>It must be observed that the nock of the arrow being constrained
to move, as it does move in the last case, causes a
pressure of the arrow upon the bow (owing to its slanting
position on the bow, and its simultaneous rapidity of passage),
and therefore a reacting pressure of the bow upon the arrow.
This makes the bow have quite a different effect upon the
deviation from what it had in the first case, when the arrow
moved slowly and gradually upon the bow (being held by the
nock), the obstacle presented by the half-breadth of the bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
then causing a deviation <i>wholly</i> to the left. The pressure now
considered, however, has a tendency to cause deviation to the
left only during the first part of the arrow's passage upon the
bow, whilst during the second part it causes a deviation to the
right; or, more correctly speaking, the pressure of the bow
upon the arrow has a tendency to cause a deviation to the left
<i>so long as the centre of gravity of the arrow is within the bow,
and vice versâ</i>. So that, if this were the only force acting
upon the arrow, its centre of gravity (this is, of course, the
point upon which the arrow, balanced horizontally, will poise)
should lie midway in that part of the arrow which is in contact
with the bow during the bow's recoil. There is another force
which contributes towards this acting and reacting pressure
between the arrow and the bow at the loose if the nocking-place
of the string be properly fitted to the arrow, but not
otherwise. As the fingers are disengaged from the string
they communicate a tendency to spin to the string, and this
spin immediately applies the arrow to the bow if it should
happen to be off the bow through side-wind or that troublesome
failing of beginners and others of a crooked pinch between the
fingers upon the nock of the arrow. It will be observed that
if the nocking-place be too small to fill the nock of the arrow
this tendency to spin in the string will not affect the replacement
of the arrow; but if the nocking-place be a good fit to the
nock, the former must be a trifle flattened, and so communicate
the spin of the string to the arrow in the shape of a blow
upon the bow. It is not pretended that no arrow will fly
straight unless the nocking-place fit the arrow. If the string
be home in the nock the shot will still be correctly delivered,
because the very close and violent pressure of the string on the
nock will arrest the spin and so apply the arrow; but if the
string be not home in the nock at the delivery of the loose,
there is great danger that the nock will be broken, either from
the nocking-place being too small, or from the other fault of
its being too big. It is this spin given to the string as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
arrow is loosed that necessitates the delivery of the arrow
from the other side of the bow when the thumb-loose of the
Oriental archer is employed, because this loose communicates
the same spin, but reversed, to the string.</p>

<p>The struggle of these forces is clearly indicated by the
appearance of the arrow where it comes in contact with the
bow when it leaves the string. It is here that the arrow always
shows most wear. It is also shown by the deep groove
that gets worn by the arrow in a bow that has seen much
service.</p>

<p>The nature of the dynamical action may be thus briefly
explained. The first impulse given to the arrow, being instantaneous
and very great (sufficient, as has been seen, to
break the arrow if the string be not home in the nock) in
proportion to any other forces which act upon it, impresses
a very high initial velocity in the direction of the aim, and
this direction the arrow recovers notwithstanding the slight
deviations caused by the mutual action between the arrow
and bow before explained&mdash;these in fact, as has been shown,
counteracting each other.</p>

</div>

<p>The recoil of the bow, besides the motion in the direction
of aim, impresses a rotary motion upon the arrow about its
centre of gravity. This tendency to rotate, however, about an
axis through its centre of gravity is counteracted by the
feathers. For, suppose the arrow to be shot off with a slight
rotary motion about a vertical axis, in a short time its point
will deviate to the left of the plane of projection, and the
centre of gravity will be the only point which continues in
that plane. The feathers of the arrow will now be turned to
the right of the same plane, and, through the velocity of the
arrow, will cause a considerable resistance of the air against
them. This resistance will twist the arrow until its point comes
to the right of the plane of projection, when it will begin to
turn the arrow the contrary way. Thus, through the agency
of the feathers, the deviation of the point of the arrow from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the plane of projection is confined within very narrow limits.
Any rotation of the arrow about a horizontal axis will be
counteracted in the same way by the action of the feathers.
Both these tendencies may be distinctly observed in the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
initial motion of the arrow. In the discussion of these rotations
of the arrow about vertical and horizontal axes the bow
is supposed to be held in a vertical position.</p>

<p>If the foregoing reasoning be carefully considered, it will
be seen how prejudicial to the correct flight of the arrow in
the direction of the aim any variation in the shape of that
part of it which is in contact with the bow must necessarily
be; for by this means an additional force is introduced into
the elements of its flight. Take for example the chested
arrow, which is smallest at the point and largest at the
feathers: here there is during its whole passage over the bow
a constant and increasing deviation to the left of the direction
of aim, caused by the arrow's shape, independent of, and in
addition to, a deviation in the like direction caused by the
retention of the nock upon the string. Thus this description
of arrow has greater difficulty in recovering its initial
direction, the forces opposed to its doing so being so much
increased. Accordingly, in practice, the chested arrow has
always a tendency to fly to the left. These chested arrows
are mostly <i class="term">flight-arrows</i>, made very light, for long-distance
shooting, and they are made of this shape to prevent their
being too weak-waisted to bear steadily the recoil of very
strong bows.</p>

<p>As regards the <i class="term">bobtailed arrow</i>, which is largest at the
point and smallest at the feathers, the converse is true to
the extent that this description of arrow will deviate towards
the left less than either the straight or chested arrow; moreover,
any considerable bobtailedness would render an arrow so
weak-waisted that it would be useless.</p>

<p>There is another arrow, known as the <i class="term">barrelled arrow</i>,
which is largest in the middle, and tapers thence towards each
end. The quickest flight may be obtained with this sort of
arrow, as to it may be applied a lighter pile without bringing
on either the fault of a chested arrow or the weak-waistedness
of a bobtailed arrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
If the tapering be of equal amount at each end of the
arrow, the pressure will act and react in precisely the same
manner as in the case of the cylindrical arrow, with the result
that this arrow will fly straight in the direction in which it is
aimed. The cylindrical and the barrelled shapes are therefore
recommended as the best for target-shooting. And as the
barrelled is necessarily stronger in the waist and less likely to
flirt, even if a light arrow be used with a strong bow, this
shape is perhaps better than the cylindrical.</p>

<p>The <i class="term">feathering</i> of the arrow is about the most delicate part
of the fletcher's craft, and it requires the utmost care and experience
to effect it thoroughly well. It seems difficult now to
realise why the feathering of the arrow came to have grown
to the size in use during Mr. Ford's time, when the feather
occupied the whole distance between the archer's fingers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the place on the bow where the arrow lies when it is nocked
previous to shooting&mdash;i.e. the length of the feather was upwards
of five inches. Mr. H. Elliott was the first archer who,
about fifteen years ago, reduced the dimensions of the feathers
of his arrows by cutting off the three inches of each feather
furthest from the nock. He found this reduction enabled the
arrow to fly further. Others soon followed his example, and
in the course of about twelve months all the arrow-makers had
supplied their customers with arrows of the new pattern, which,
however, cannot be called a new pattern, as Oriental arrows, and
many flight-arrows, were much less heavily feathered. The
long feathering is now scarcely ever seen, except occasionally
when it is erroneously used to diminish the difficulty of shooting
at sixty yards. Mr. Ford recommended rather full-sized
feathers 'as giving a steadiness to the flight.' With the reduced
feathers arrows fly as steadily, and certainly more
keenly towards the mark. A fair amount of rib should be
left on the feather, for if the rib be pared too fine the lasting
quality of the feather will be diminished. The three feathers
of an arrow should be from the same wing, right or left; and
as none but a raw beginner will find any difficulty in nocking
his arrow the right way&mdash;i.e. with what is known as the cock
feather upwards, or at right angles to the line of the nock&mdash;without
having this cock feather of a different colour, it is advisable
to have the three feathers all alike. Perhaps the brown feathers
of the peacock's wing are the best of all, but the black turkey-feathers
are also highly satisfactory. The white turkey-feathers
are also equally good, but had better be avoided, as
they too readily get soiled, and are not to be easily distinguished
from white goose-feathers. These last, as well as
those of the grey goose, though highly thought of by our forefathers,
are now in no repute, and it is probable that our
ancestors, if they had had the same plentiful supply of peafowls
and turkeys as ourselves, would have had less respect
for the wings of geese. The reason why the three feathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
must be from the same wing is that every feather is outwardly
convex and inwardly concave. When the feathers are correctly
applied, all three alike, this their peculiarity of form
rifles the arrow or causes it to rotate on its own axis. This
may be tested by shooting an arrow through a pane of glass,
when it will be found that the scraping against the arrow of
the sharp edges of the fracture passes along the arrow spirally.
Some years ago a very unnecessary patent was taken out for
rifling an arrow by putting on the feathers spirally, over-doing
what was already sufficient. As regards the position of
the feather, it should be brought as near as possible to the nock.
Some consider an inch in length of feather quite sufficient.
It is certain that any length between two inches and one
inch will do; so each individual may please himself and suit
the length of the feathering to the length and weight of his
arrows. The two shapes in use are the triangular and the
parabolic or balloon-shaped. Of these both are good&mdash;the
former having the advantage of carrying the steerage further
back, whilst the latter is a trifle stiffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The feathers are preserved from damp by a coat of oil paint
laid on between them and for one-eighth of an inch above and
below them. This should afterwards be varnished, and the rib
of the feather should be carefully covered, but care must be
taken to avoid injuring the suppleness of the feather with the
varnish. Feathers laid down or ruffled by wet may be restored
by spinning the arrow before a warm fire carefully.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i class="term">pile</i>, or point, is an important part of the arrow. Of
the different shapes that have been used, the best for target-shooting&mdash;now
almost the only survivor&mdash;is the square-shouldered
parallel pile. Its greatest advantage is, that if the
arrow be overdrawn so that the pile be brought on to the
bow, the aim will not be injured, as must be the case with all
conical piles so drawn. (Very light flight-arrows, for which the
piles provided for ladies are considered too heavy, must still be
furnished with the conical piles used for children's arrows.)
This parallel pile is mostly made in two pieces&mdash;a pointed cone
for its point, which is soldered on to the cylindrical part, which
itself is made of a flat piece of metal soldered into this form.
This same-shaped pile has occasionally been made turned out
of solid metal; but this pile is liable to be so heavy as to be
unsuitable for any but the heaviest arrows, and the fletchers
aver that it is difficult to fix it on firmly owing to the grease
used in its manufacture. Great care should be taken, in the
manufacture of arrows, that the footing exactly fits the pile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
so as to fill entirely the inside of it; unless the footing of the
arrow reach the bottom of the pile, the pile will either crumple
up or be driven down the stele when the pile comes in contact
with a hard substance. It is, of course, fixed on with glue;
and to prevent its coming off from damp, a blow, or the
adhesiveness of stiff clay, it is well to indent it on each side
with a sharp hard-pointed punch fitted for the purpose with
a groove, in which the arrow is placed whilst the necessary
pressure is applied. This instrument may be procured of
Hill &amp; Son, cutlers, 4 Haymarket.</p>

<p>The <i class="term">nock</i> should be strong, and very carefully finished, so
that no injury may be done by the string or to the string.
Of course the nock must be of the same size in section as the
stele of the arrow; and this furnishes an additional argument
against the bobtailed arrow, which is smallest at this end.
The notch or groove in which the string acts should be about
one-eighth of an inch wide and about three-sixteenths of an
inch deep. The bottom of this notch will be much improved
by the application of a round file of the right gauge, i.e. quite
a trifle more than the eighth of an inch in diameter; but great
care must be taken to apply this uniformly, and the nock
must not be unduly weakened. This application will enable
the archer to put thicker, and therefore safer, lapping to the
nocking-place of the string, and the danger of the string being
loose in the nock will be lessened. It is possible that this
additional grooving of the nock may to a very trifling extent
impede the escape of the arrow from the string. Mr. Ford
recommended the application of a copper rivet through the
nock near to the bottom of the notch to provide against the
danger of splitting the nock. But it is so doubtful whether
any rivet fine enough for safe application would be strong
enough to guard against this danger, that the better plan will
be to avoid the different sorts of carelessness that lead towards
this accident.</p>

<p>As regards the <i class="term">length</i> of the arrow no arbitrary rule can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be laid down. The arrow most generally in use is twenty-eight
inches in length from the point of the pile to the bottom
of the groove of the nock. This arrow may be easily drawn
up by any man of average height&mdash;the twenty-seven inches, or
the clothyard length of the old English archer, leaving the inch
of pile undrawn. A taller man may venture to draw the pile.
An arrow of twenty-nine inches may be adopted by those who
have very long arms or are unusually tall. Those who are
short of stature or short in limb may adopt the shorter arrow
of twenty-seven inches. Shorter arrows than this will be
found to fly unsteadily, and the longer arrows, if thoroughly
drawn up, are very trying to the bows. The shorter arrows
of twenty-seven inches in length have been in much more
frequent use since about 1862, when the late T. L. Coulson
adopted them, and advocated that it was better to draw up a
shorter arrow than to leave a longer one undrawn. The fault
of drawing not far enough is so much more frequent than that
of overdrawing, that archers are strongly recommended to
avoid shortening their arrow unadvisedly, and rather to draw
the longer ones as far as they reasonably can. The fault of
overdrawing is so dangerous to the archer, his tackle, and
others, that, though an unfrequent fault, a caution against it
must not be omitted. Whatever be the length of the arrow,
it should always be drawn up to exactly the same point.</p>

<p>The <i class="term">weight</i> of the arrow must to a certain extent be regulated
by its length and by the strength of the bow with which
it is to be used; for if an arrow be a long one it must have
bulk sufficient to ensure its stiffness, and stiffness also in
proportion to the strength of the bow. 4<i>s.</i> for the lowest, and
5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the highest weight, are the two extremes within
which every length of arrow and strength of bow may be properly
fitted, so far as gentlemen are concerned. For ladies,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> should be about the limits. It should be
borne in mind that light arrows, unless dictated by physical
weakness, are a mistake in target-shooting. For flight-shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
very light-chested arrows may be procured stiff enough
for any strength of bow; but in this style of shooting distance
to be covered is of more importance than accuracy of aim.
It would be much better if the arrow-makers, instead of selling
their arrows in sets, progressing by three silver pennyweights,
would sell them also weighed to the intermediate pennyweights.
As the matter stands now, supposing the archer's
favourite weight to be 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, he may have at one time a set
weighing rather less than 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and at another time rather
more than 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> As all the intermediate weights of arrows
are manufactured, there can be no sufficient reason why the
lighter set should not be marked and sold as 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and the
heavier as 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> A careful archer should attend also to
the balance of his arrows. By this is meant that the same
centre of gravity should pervade the whole set. Longer or
shorter, lighter or heavier footing will vary this balancing-point,
as also any variation in the weight of the piles.</p>

<p>As the variation of elevation, or distance to be shot,
should not be managed by a change of weight in arrows, it is
decidedly advisable to keep arrows all of the same weight, &amp;c.
Indeed it is a great mistake to change any part of the tackle,
bow or arrow, during the shooting, except in unavoidable
cases. The scoring will seldom be bettered by such means.</p>

<p>Formerly only two arrows were shot at each end, and
three were carried, and called an 'archer's pair,' including
the spare one. Now it is the almost universal custom to
shoot three arrows at each end. Some spare ones should, of
course, be at hand in case of accidents. It must be remembered
that if the slightest variation in shape or weight occurs
amongst those in use, the line or elevation is sure to be
affected, to the serious detriment of accurate hitting; therefore
too much care cannot be taken in their choice.</p>

<p>Whether it be for store or for daily use, the arrow should
be kept in a quiver or case made on such a plan that each
shall have its separate cell, and they should be kept upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
when possible, and so be insured from warping, or from
having their feathers crushed. It is too much the custom to
squeeze a quantity of arrows into a small quiver. Let not
any archer who values his tackle be guilty of this folly. An
arrow that has had one of its feathers crumpled from this
cause will, maybe, wobble and stagger all the rest of its life,
though in all other respects it be in perfect repair. Arrows
will be found to wear out quite speedily enough without being
subjected to ill-usage or neglect to hurry them through their
short lives.</p>

<p>It appears to be well authenticated that if a light-chested
flight-arrow be feathered at each end, with the feathers trimmed
lower at the nock than at the pile end, when shot against the
wind it will return back again like a boomerang. And if the
same-shaped arrow be feathered in the middle only, it will in
its flight make a right angle, and no power of bow can send
it any considerable distance.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Hely-Hutchinson, already mentioned as having made
experiments in modern times with steel bows, had another
peculiarity. On the back of his bow he had a flat piece of
hard wood or metal fixed at right angles to the length of his
bow. An upright piece of the same material was fitted into
a groove in this, whose outside distance was about an inch
from the place where the arrow usually touches the bow
above the handle. He used always to shoot with his arrow
resting, not on the bow, or on his hand, but in the outside
angle between this projection and the upright piece of it. He
aimed as other archers do, and has been seen to make excellent
hitting at the distance of one hundred yards, even
when far advanced in years. In this case the axis of the
arrow, or the line of aim, was distant from the plane through
the string and the axis of the bow an inch in addition to the
usual half-width of the arrow and half-width of the bow. Yet
the arrow appeared to fly quite steadily and truly. It is not
known why he adopted this peculiarity, and it is unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to inquire; but it will serve as a useful peg whereon to hang a
further consideration of the difficulties an arrow has to contend
with in getting straight to the point of aim, and its determined
resolution to overcome these difficulties. In addition to the
forces already discussed as acting upon the arrow, there is
also the force of gravity, the resistance of the air, and the
interference of the wind; but these forces affect in the same
way all arrows, however shot. The same may be said of all
the other forces implicated, until there is an artificially increased
impediment interposed in addition to the natural one
of the half-bow and half-arrow. Now, supposing the distance
of the nock from the centre of the bow be such when the
arrow is drawn that a perpendicular let fall from the centre of
the bow to the line of aim will mark off twenty-seven inches of
draw, the resolution of the force acting in the line from the nock
to the centre of the bow will be correctly represented by twenty-seven
in the direction of the point of aim and three-eighths at
right angles to that direction; or the relation between the
straight part of the whole force and its remainder will be as
216 to 5.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Hutchinson's peculiar method of shooting
is compared with this natural way, it will appear that the
relation between these same resolved forces will be as 216
to 13; showing that the obstruction in this latter case has
been considerably more than doubled&mdash;the keenness of flight
will be diminished, and increased <i class="term">friction</i> will be shown between
the arrow and its resting-place at the instant of the loose.</p>

<p>Besides the spin given to the string at the loose, there is also
a push, at right angles to the direction delivered, by the more or
less unavoidable obstruction of the fingers as they liberate the
string; but this push, occurring before the liberation of the
string, is the final difficulty of the aim and loose.</p>

<p>Immediately the string is loosed the arrow has, as it were,
the nocking-place between its teeth in the nock, and contributes
to the direction of its course to the point of rest; and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
highly probable that the path of the nocking-place from the
loose to rest is not confined to the plane of the string and axis
of the bow.</p>

<p>Greater or diminished friction between the bow and arrow
would be another way of representing greater or less obstruction
to the aim of the arrow. As the arrow deepens the
groove made by its passage over the bow the obstruction will
be diminished, but the surface exposed to this friction will be
increased.</p>

<p>If a bow could be so constructed that an arrow could be
shot through it just above the handle, the opening must be
large enough to admit free passage for the feathering as well,
and the opening must be contrived so that the 'stele,' true
to the point of aim throughout its passage through the bow,
shall never swerve from the right side of the opening.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER IV.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF THE STRING, BRACER, AND SHOOTING-GLOVE</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The best bowstrings are all of Belgian make, and cannot be
considered of such good quality as they used to be twenty-five
years ago. Then the best bowstrings were obtained from a
maker at Liège, by name Meeles, the last of his race, who, with
his wife, kept most jealously the secret of the manufacture,
which had been transmitted through many generations in the
one family, and they died childless without communicating it
to anyone. Their residence was kept with the windows on the
street side constantly barred up, so as to make sure that they
could not be overlooked, and they depended entirely for the
air and light necessary for their labour on the private garden
at the back of the house.</p>

<p>In the choice of a string see that it has three, not two,
strands; and care must be taken to avoid those that are too
hard and stiff, as they are liable to be brittle and to break
very soon. The next thing to be attended to is that the string
is smooth and round throughout, and sufficiently increased in
bulk at the ends where are the eye and loop. It cannot be
doubted that a quicker cast may be obtained from a <i class="term">thin string</i>
than from a <i class="term">very thick one</i>; but it will be better to choose
strings strong enough in proportion to the strength of the
bows to ensure their (i.e. the bows') safety rather than to pay
too much regard to this quickness of cast. When the string
is chosen its eye must be fitted into the groove of the lower
horn of the bow. In order to make <i class="term">the loop</i> at the other end
the string must now be applied to the back of the unbent bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and the first rounded turn of the loop must be made at about
three inches from the groove of the upper horn, or two and a
half inches in the case of a lady's bow. At about the distance
of one inch and a quarter beyond&mdash;and one inch in the case of
a lady's string&mdash;the crown of this rounded turn the string must
be sharply bent back, and this sharp bend applied round the
string on the other side of the rounded turn. Slip the sharp
turn a little further down the string towards the eye, and
twist the remaining reversed end of the string three times
round the looped part of the string, beginning inwards. The
sharp turn must then be pushed back into the first bent position.
The eye must now be passed over the upper horn, and
passed far enough down the bow to allow the loop to be passed
over the lower horn and into its groove, and the loop should
be so applied into this groove that the waste end of string shall
lie between the sharp turn and the horn (see fig. 16). If the
waste end of the string be then knotted firmly, and the remainder
cut off, the loop will be finished, and, if successfully managed,
will never shift or stretch when it has once reached its bearings.
The virtue in this loop is that it is quite fast and tight
when in use, and yet it can be very readily slipped off and
opened for readjustment on the same bow, or for application to
another bow of different length. By far the neatest finish to
a bowstring is the addition of a <i class="term">second eye</i> instead of the <i class="term">loop</i>,
and this is now very readily done by the bowmakers for their
customers at a small additional charge; but every handy
archer should learn how to make this second eye for himself.
The following method is recommended. When the loop has
been correctly adjusted, so that the string, when the bow is
braced, is at a suitable distance from the bow (i.e. six inches
or so for a man's bow, or five and a half inches for a lady's bow)
mark with ink the crown of the rounded turn before mentioned
(i.e. the point of the string, not of the waste twisted round the
string in the loop nearest to the upper horn). Now unbrace
the bow and take off the string. Undo the loop and straighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
out the string (see fig. 15). At the distance of one inch and a
quarter (one inch is sufficient for a lady's string) from the
ink-mark, and on each side of it, tie tight round the string a
small piece of fine waxed thread; cut off the waste end of the
string at the knot made in finishing the loop. Keep the part
of the string between the two ties well wound up during the
whole of the succeeding stages of the manufacture of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
part into an eye so as to correct the necessary unwindings.
Unwind up to <span class="smcap small">C</span>, fig. 17, completely separate, and straighten
out the three strands (1), (2), (3), fig. 17, of the remaining
portion of the waste end of the string up to its tie at <span class="smcap small">C</span>. Pass
a small marlinespike or stiletto between each of the three
strands of the string, just beyond the other tie at <span class="smcap small">B</span>, and as
close to it as possible. Flatten out the three unwound strands
of the waste end fingerwise (fig. 17). Bend (keeping it wound
up) the part of the string between the two ties <span class="smcap small">B</span> and <span class="smcap small">C</span>, so as
to bring these two ties exactly together, with the separated
strands (1), (2), (3) lying across the string at right angles to its
worm (see fig. 18). Now insert the middle strand (1), fig. 19
(taking care to cross the worm of the string), with the help of
the marlinespike under that strand of the string across which
it lay in fig. 18.</p>

<p>Give the commenced eye a quarter turn to the left (see

<p>Strand (2) now lies across the strand of the string under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which strand (1) has just been passed, and the next strand of
the string. Insert it (2) under this latter strand, and give the
eye another quarter turn, showing strand (2) inserted (see
fig. 21).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 21.</span>
</div>

<p>Strand (3) as shown in fig. 21 must now be bent to the left
across the central upright strand of the string, and passed
under that strand and brought out and back towards the right
again (see fig. 22).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 22.</span>
</div>

<p>The loop will now be an <i class="term">eye</i>, as soon as the two ties <span class="smcap small">B</span>
and <span class="smcap small">C</span> have been brought close together again, and the three
strands, loosened by constant manipulation, have been carefully
waxed and wound up again.</p>

<p>From this point there are two methods of proceeding: the
one, which will complete the eye so as to resemble the manufactured
eye, by winding each waste strand round and round
its own corresponding strand; and for this method the waste
strands should now be <i class="term">tapered</i> before they are wound in.
By the other method each waste strand in turn should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
passed over the next strand and under the next but one.
The waste strands will again occupy alternate positions
between the other strands. Wind up and wax the waste
strands again carefully. Enough has now been done to secure
the safety of the <i class="term">eye-splice</i>; but it will be best to splice in
once again each of the waste strands; then bind tightly over
the waste for about half an inch down the string, and cut off
the remaining waste strands.</p>

<p>In order to taper the waste strands, divide each into two
equal parts, lengthwise, after the position shown in fig. 22
has been completed, and with a blunt knife fine down each
of the two parts gradually till each tapers to nothing at the
length of about two and a half inches from the string; now
work in as much wax as possible, flattening each of the divided
portions in so doing; readjust the divided portions, and
wind them carefully together again. The waste ends may
then be wound round and round the appropriate strands until
they disappear; or the first method of splicing may be continued
till they fade off and disappear, so that the finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
process of binding and cutting off the waste ends may be
dispensed with. Don't bind the eye with string, leather, or
any other material. If the string was originally sufficiently
thicker at this part, its final failure is very unlikely to occur
at either of the eyes, and there is a general belief that any
<i class="term">unnecessary clothing</i> of the eye interferes with the cast of the
string. If the waste strands, <i class="term">untapered</i>, be spliced in and
in very frequently, the string will be somewhat shortened.
A string that is too short&mdash;i.e. too far from the bow when
braced&mdash;cannot be lengthened without altering the loop or
remaking the eye, but a string that is slightly too long&mdash;i.e.
not giving sufficient distance between the string and bow when
braced&mdash;can be shortened by spinning it up tighter; but care
must be taken not to attempt this operation with a hard-cemented,
new string, as it will almost certainly prove fatal
to the string, which will snap in two at the loose; and no
string should be much spun up.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered is the <i class="term">necessary clothing</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the string, called its <i class="term">lapping</i>. Without doubt the best <i class="term">lapping</i>
of all is a thin strip of <i class="term">whalebone</i>, of the width of about one-eighth
of an inch. This may be fastened on to the string at
about two inches and a half from its (the string's) centre
(this is calculated for the case of a bow whose centre or
fulcrum is one inch below the top of the handle: if the
centre be at the top of the handle, as in old Flemish bows,
the lapping need not be so long, and if the centre be lower
down than one inch, as in the Scotch make of bows, the lapping
must be still longer) with very fine string, waxed thread,
or silk, so that the whalebone lapping may be wrapped closely
round the string in the reversed direction to the grain or worm
of the string.</p>

<p>Let an arrow be now applied, resting on the top of the
bow hand as if the hand holds the handle of the bow in shooting,
and exactly at right angles to the braced string. This
exact right angle must be carefully attended to, because, if
the upper angle be an acute angle between the arrow and
string, cast or force will be lost in the force of the cast being
resolved, as shown previously in the case of an increased impediment,
acting as an obstruction to the right line of force:
the arrow will beat itself wastefully on the top of the hand in
overcoming the unnecessary impediment; and, if this upper
angle be an obtuse angle, the difference between the lower and
upper portions of the string will be increased, to the manifest
injury of the pre-arranged balance of the limbs of the bow.
Mark carefully on the lapping the exact position of the centre
of the nock of the arrow, and overlap with two or three strands
of waxed filoselle very tightly for about one-third of an inch,
with the mark under its centre. This is the nocking-place.
The whalebone lapping must be carried down to the length
of five inches in order to save the string from being frayed
against the sleeve, armguard, &amp;c.; and it will be found that
this length of lapping will be sufficient for another nocking-place
if the string, already provided with two eyes, be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
over. The occasional use of the second nocking-place will
be found to lengthen the life of the string by changing the
position of the wear and tear. A narrow strip of vellum used
frequently to be used for lapping, and was applied
in the same way as the whalebone. Long
strips of the smooth hard covering of the rib of
the peacock's tail-feathers were also in high favour
as lapping at one time, but were found to be too
frail. The lapping usually applied to the strings,
as bought in the shops, is three strands, bound
on together, of waxed twine, about the substance
used for chemists' parcels, and the three strands
are applied together, not so much in order to finish
the lapping more quickly, as to safeguard the
bow from breaking should the string snap. The
dangerous recoil is then caught up by the triple
strength of lapping twine well secured upon the
string. This, of course, is supposing that the
string has broken at or near the nocking-place.
It is probable that every possible sort of twine has
been at different times tried for lapping&mdash;from the
softest floss silk to the most wiry fishing-guts,
which actually help to cut the string when in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 23.</span>
</div>

<p>After all, the best lapping is that which will
give a good loose, and at the same time will be
lasting and be easily and quickly repaired should
it fail during the shooting. Now all the lappings
already mentioned are liable to get loose in use,
and it takes time to refasten them. The following
somewhat tedious process, the result of more than
twenty years of experience, is recommended.
Take a naked string with two eyes, and make a pencil-mark
on it for the exact central position of each of the two nocking-places.
Wax the string well. Wrap two strands nine inches
long of waxed (yellow) filoselle tightly upon the string at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
each nocking-place for the third of an inch, with the pencil-mark
under the centre of this third. Fasten off so that the
waste ends shall come out close to these centres. Do not cut
off the waste ends. Now take three strands of waxed filoselle
of another colour (red), and in length from one yard to four
feet. Wrap this tightly round the string, commencing from
one and a quarter inch above the one nocking-place, and
ending at the same distance below the other. Apply this
wrapping the contrary way to the worm of the string, and let
the waste ends of the previous wrapping (it does not signify
which way this is applied) pass out between the wraps as they
occur. Now take other three strands of (green) waxed filoselle,
of the same length, and wrap them tightly on over all the
last wrapping of red; but this time wrap the same way as the
worm of the string. Again let the first ends of the yellow
wrapping pass out. The principal wrapping is now complete,
and the waste ends of (yellow) filoselle are ready in place
to complete the necessary thickening for the nocking-places.
This lapping is very firm and lasting. It cannot get loose in
use, and it is in every part capable of almost instantaneous
repair, and the archer has no need to carry about him any
other materials than a few pieces of filoselle, some wax, and
a knife.</p>

<p>The most convenient position for lapping a string is
assumed by passing the left leg through between the braced
bow and its string and sitting down with the string uppermost
and the bow stave under the thigh. This description
of the operation of lapping will be incomplete without instructions
for fastening off, for the benefit of beginners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
  <img src="images/i-054.jpg" width="294" height="400" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 24.</span>
</div>

<p>In the commencement of lapping the end is passed under,
and the wrapping is tightly bound over it five or six times,
till it is considered sufficiently secure. To finish off, the same
operation is reversed, thus: arrest the lapping by passing
the filoselle, or whatever the material in use may be, over
the thumb of the left hand, interposed between the lapping-material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and the string. Wrap the lapping material upon the
string the reverse way to that in which it has been previously
wrapped about five or six times (see fig. 22). Keep the
material <i>a b</i> tight-drawn with the left thumb whilst this is
being done. Now draw the end <i>c</i> (fig. 24) close to the string,
and along its length, so that it may lie close between part <i>a</i>
and the string. Now take the piece <i>a b</i> from off the left
thumb, and draw the part <i>a</i> up to the lapping already applied.
Bind part <i>a</i> on to the string. This binding will unwind the
part <i>b</i>. Continue this till all <i>b</i> is unwound from the string
and wound on again. Now hold tight the remainder unwound
of <i>a b</i> with the left hand. Draw it
through under the lapping with the
right hand; but the surplus portion
of <i>a b</i> to be drawn through must be
kept tight to the last by the insertion
of the left little finger to prevent kinking
and cockling, which would spoil
the finish. With the same object in
view, keep the waste part <i>a b</i> as short
as possible. Filoselle, being a loosely
wound material, easily passes through
this finish, but the kinking of some of
the other tight-wound materials renders this finish troublesome
if it have to be drawn under many wraps.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Bracer or Armguard.</h3>

<p>The object of the <i class="term">armguard</i> or <i class="term">bracer</i> is to protect the left
arm and wrist from the blow of the string <i>in the event of</i> this
striking upon it when loosed. The expression 'in the event of'
is especially meant to imply that in most cases no need exists
for the string's striking the arm at all; but if the bow be low-strung&mdash;or
follow the string, as it is called&mdash;it is impossible to
avoid an occasional smart blow in the neighbourhood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
left wrist, and this must be guarded against. For this purpose
a short armguard, covering the wrist and that half of the
forearm, will be all-sufficient. As regards the blow of the
string upon this limited sort of armguard, it may be observed
that it cannot injuriously affect the flight of the arrow, as it
occurs most probably after the arrow has left the string.
This protection for the wrist should extend up the arm, but
very little beyond the point where the bowstring would touch
the arm when the properly-braced bow is extended at arm's
length. For this armguard a piece of thin leather, laced
closely at the back of the forearm, answers very well. Should
this be too thin to save the arm from the blow of the string,
let a piece of stiff card be slipped between the sleeve and the
wrist. The sleeve about the wrist should be made to fit as
closely as possible, and all other materials&mdash;cuffs, shirt-sleeves,
&amp;c.&mdash;discarded, or rolled up above the elbow. Care must also
be taken to avoid all wrinkles and folds in the sleeve between
the guard and the elbow. This can be best managed by
having the sleeve no atom too long, and drawing it as far
down the hand as possible whilst the guard is being fixed. It
is unfortunate that the seam along the inside of almost every
sleeve occurs just where it helps to manufacture folds and projections
ready to act as impediments to the passage of the
string. Some archers use stout elastic webbing, and others
wrap round the wrist strong braid, &amp;c. The main object of all
these guards is to avoid the blow of the string until the string
shall have advanced so far in its course to rest as to be unable
to interfere with the direction of a properly aimed arrow. Some
archers, shooting with the bow in the left hand, aim with the
left (not with the right) eye, and this peculiarity makes it
rather more difficult to avoid hitting the forearm at some point
between the elbow and the short guard. With others, when the
left arm, holding the bow, is extended straight out, and stiffened
at the elbow, it will be found to bend inwards&mdash;knock-kneed,
as it were. In such cases it would probably be better to widen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the handle of the bow, so as to remove the inner outline of
the arm farther from the plane in which the string acts, than
to increase the certainty of an aim-disturbing blow by adding
the thickness of an armguard to the already existing impediment;
or&mdash;but this is only mentioned as an alternative, not
recommended for general adoption&mdash;the arm may be slightly
bent outwards at the elbow. Some try to avoid this unnecessary
hitting of the arm by keeping their bows very high-strung;
but this should be avoided, as it is very trying to both
the bow and the string, and it is generally believed that by
keeping a bow high-strung some of its cast is lost.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned bracer, of which there are still many
modern representatives&mdash;although Mr. Ford, in his book, successfully
demolished the 'armguard-hitting theory,' which was
upheld by most previous writers on the subject&mdash;was, and is,
certainly admirably calculated to be hit as much as possible,
being often made of very thick leather, and lined and padded
as well. If something of this sort, failing other expedients to
avoid hurting the arm, must be used, let it be as thin and
close-fitting as possible, and in particular close-fitting for the
four inches or so next to the wrist, where the reckless old
armguards used to project as much as half an inch, ready to
welcome the blow of the string several inches sooner than
need be. And, to avoid the worst blow of all&mdash;that delivered
upon the top of the armguard where it is shaped to the bend
of the elbow&mdash;let the upper strap be carried round above the
elbow so that it draws the front of the guard tight as the arm
is straightened. In spite of all that has been said above, it
cannot be denied that, such is the persistent determination of
arrows well aimed and well loosed to reach the target, they
will certainly very often succeed, notwithstanding frequent
interruptions from an armguard in addition to the natural
difficulties. Too much care cannot be taken to see that when
fastened no edge or corner of the armguard protrudes that
can by possibility obstruct the free passage of the string. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
spite of good old Ascham's statement that 'the string, gliding
quickly and sharply off it' [the bracer], 'may make a sharper
shoot' (he also advised that the bow be high-strung, so that
this hitting may be avoided), the guard should be made of
moderately soft and yielding but perfectly smooth leather,
and not of any hard material. The silver armguard, which
may be fitting enough as a trophy for the Field Captain of
the Royal Toxophilite Society, would be about as much out of
place during the shooting of the York Round as the ancient
Scorton arrow would be amongst the shafts in use during one
of the annual Yorkshire meetings.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Shooting-Glove, and other Protections
for the Fingers.</h3>

<p>The old-fashioned archer's glove&mdash;still in use in Scotland,
and perhaps occasionally elsewhere&mdash;resembles a boxing-glove,
being made of thick buckskin, and calculated to protect the
hand from some of the accidents of war. It was provided
with a pocket for extra strings, wax, and other necessaries on
its back; and no doubt owned a companion glove for the bow
hand, also calculated to protect <i>it</i> from injury. This glove
has pieces of hard leather sewn on to the ends of the fingers
as a further protection against the string; and leather straps,
passing round the roots of the fingers and along the back of
the hand, are tied tightly round the wrist to prevent the finger-guards
from being dragged forward out of place at the loose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;">
  <img src="images/i-058.jpg" width="236" height="500" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 25.</span>
</div>

<p>The protection for the fingers, which is probably best
known to beginners and old-fashioned archers, consists of
three conical tips or thimbles of leather, each sewn up at the
back of the finger, and attached&mdash;also at the back&mdash;to long
strips of leather, connected at the back of the hand so as to
form one piece, which is fixed upon a strap which passes
round the wrist and is fastened securely by a buckle (fig. 25).
There is nothing to be said against this description of shooting-glove
if a thimble can be got to fit each of the fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
accurately; but, as it can seldom happen that in a ready-made
article a perfect fit can be found, this form of finger-guard
has become unfashionable, and has gone out of favour. It was
probably never made with the thimbles of the right sort of
leather (horse-butt), as the softer and more pliable sorts of
leather would be more suitable
to fit all comers. It effectually
obviates one of the difficulties
which occurs to most beginners&mdash;that
of recovering their tips
when they have been scattered
all over the shooting-lawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i-059.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 26.</span>
</div>

<p>The 'tab' (see fig. 26) is probably
one of the most ancient
of finger-guards, and it has so
many merits that it can never
be altogether discarded. Any
archer may quickly manufacture
it out of almost any sort
of leather, and it is very readily
altered or replaced, and it is
no impediment to the free use
of the fingers for other purposes
than loosing an arrow. The
whole of the first finger of the
right hand is passed right
through the opening A from
the side not seen, and the tip
of the finger is placed on <i>a</i>. The third finger is similarly
passed through B, and its tip lies on [Greek: b]. The middle finger is
now placed on <i>b</i>. It will be found that the 'tab' is now
securely fastened for use, the string being applied to the side
not seen. The tab can be readily turned down into the palm
of the hand whilst the arrow is applied to the string. The
tab is then replaced on the tips of the fingers and applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to the string, with the arrow at the bottom of the opening
between the parts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The one drawback to this description
of finger-guard is that the arrow comes into actual
contact with the sides of the first and second fingers, and
beginners are specially perplexed with the difficulty of keeping
the arrow applied to the proper place on the side of the bow
during the operation of pulling up, owing to too tight a pinch
between the fingers, given by the bent string. This same
difficulty occurs also with other guards, but the results are
not so painful, as the corner of the nail is protected by leather
from the nock of the arrow. The tab is not, therefore, to be
recommended for the use of beginners. Should any archers
be tempted to use it when the first difficulties are overcome,
it will be found that the insertion of a piece of cork or leather
between the first and second fingers will overcome the trouble
caused by this pinch. The tab, as before mentioned, may be
made of one piece of leather; but it is better to have it made
of two pieces sewn together, as shown in the sketch (see fig. 26),
the part applied to the string being made of 'horse-butt,' which
is a brittle sort of leather, the part through which the fingers
are passed being made of some more supple leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Before the more elaborate and scientific finger-stall or
guards come to be considered the remaining simple and old-fashioned
ones must be completed.</p>

<p>Next in order comes an ordinary glove, which has lately
come prominently to the front, because the constant use of a
good thick dogskin glove has enabled the Champion of 1884
to keep his place in 1885 and 1886. To this may be applied the
dogmatic words of Mr. Ford (slightly altered) with reference
to the tab: 'This does not, however, alter my opinion as to
its being decidedly an inferior method, as who shall say how
much more [he] might have excelled had [he] adopted a different
and [less] rational one?'</p>

<p>A well-fitting glove may be improved
by sewing small pieces of pigskin or other
smooth sound leather over the tips of the
fingers (see fig. 27).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="200" height="207" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 27.</span>
</div>

<p>Constant practice on the harp has
been known to enable a lady to dispense
with any artificial protection, and to make
three golds at one end at one of the
Leamington meetings.</p>

<p>Another method of preparing the fingers for naked application
to the bowstring is to use them industriously as pipe-stoppers;
but as some archers do not smoke, and it might
not be easy for a non-smoker to get employment as a pipe-stopper
to others who do, a more convenient way of hardening
the fingers would be by dropping on hot sealing-wax, and then
dipping the finger into salt.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that permanently successful shooting
depends mostly upon an even, certain, and unvarying loose,
and such a loose can only be attained by the help of the most
suitable glove, tips, tab, or other protection for the fingers.
The archer must have the perfect command of the string, and
of the exact 'how' and 'when' it shall be allowed to quit the
fingers. If the glove &amp;c. be too loose or too tight, this necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
command is lost. In the first case, the feeling of insecurity
gives a hesitating uncertainty to the loose; and in the
second, the power of the fingers is so cramped that a sensation
of distortion cripples their best efforts. Further, too thick
a glove &amp;c. interferes with the proper 'feel' of the string;
whilst one that is too thin, by hurting the fingers, causes
them to flinch from the proper degree of crisp sharpness
requisite for a perfect loose. Still further, with too hard a
substance&mdash;metal, for instance: finger-tips have been occasionally
made of silver&mdash;the string cannot be with certainty
retained till the proper instant of loosing, whilst with leather
that is too soft and sodden, the string cannot be quitted without
a jerk that staggers the bow-arm.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that positive rules cannot be laid
down as to either the size, make, shape, or material of the
finger-guards; as each individual must be suited according
to the peculiar nature of his own fingers, be they callous or
tender, strong or weak, clumsy or dexterous.</p>

<p>In 1859 it may have been good advice to archers to manufacture
their own finger-guards, though Mr. Ford candidly
confessed 'that the endeavours of ten years have hardly succeeded
in producing finger-stalls perfectly to my satisfaction.'
It may be safely asserted, however, that it is better to use
the thinner leather (provided it be thick enough to protect
the fingers from pain), and the stalls must be constructed so
as to confine the hand and cramp the knuckles as little as
possible.</p>

<p>The 'Mason' finger-stall, described by Mr. Ford, consisted
of a piece of leather partly surrounding the tip of the finger,
and connected over the nail with vulcanised india-rubber,
and kept in place by a ring, also of india-rubber, or preferably
of silver, passing over both joints of the finger, and
connected inside the hand with the stall by means of a thin
tongue of india-rubber about an inch or an inch and a
half long; a guard or stop is placed upon each stall, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
half an inch from the top, by which (stop) the line of the
fingers and position of the string is regulated, &amp;c. A very
similar finger-guard, produced by Mr. Buchanan of 215
Piccadilly, was made, closed at the finger-end, so as to protect
the top of the finger from possible injury.</p>

<p>In these finger-guards the stop or catch of leather on the
inside of the finger first makes its public appearance, but the
contrivance in its entirety has completely gone out of favour&mdash;probably
owing to the untrustworthiness of india-rubber,
even though it be vulcanised. The connecting ring removed
the objection to these separate tips that, unless they were
glued on or too tight (both undesirable), they were sadly liable
to slip off at the loose. Also the connecting tongue of india-rubber
might enable the lower part of the finger to contribute
some trifle of support to the tip of the finger at its fullest
strain, and certainly it would assist to catch the finger-tip
back from the sprawled position (much objected to by some
instructors in this craft) sometimes assumed after a dead
loose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/i-062.jpg" width="200" height="77" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 28.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. James Spedding and Mr. H. C. Mules, about the same
time that Mr. H. A. Ford and others were making experiments
in the construction of their own finger-tips, contrived
a little brass nutted screw-bolt for securing the finger-tips
safely upon the fingers without the uncertain action of india-rubber,
or in any way cramping the action of the finger-joints.
This little contrivance is three-quarters of an inch long. The
nut <span class="smcap small">A</span> is fixed, but the nut <span class="smcap small">B</span> can be moved to any position on
the screw-bolt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="300" height="186" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 29.</span>
</div>

<p>This contrivance is passed through the holes at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
(see fig. 29) of a finger-tip shaped thus. Of course the end
of the screw-bolt over which the nut <span class="smcap small">B</span> is passed after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
screw-bolt has been passed through <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must be clinched
afterwards to prevent nut B coming off again. The lacing
together of the six corresponding holes on each side of the
guard at the back of the finger over the nail can be tight or
loose, according to taste; but it should be laced with fine
strong cord, not elastic, as generally supplied by the makers.
The brass bolt passes over the top joint of the finger when the
guard is put on the finger, and may then be tightened so as
to keep the guard in its place and to prevent it escaping at
the loose. Leather catches may easily be added of any shape
or in any position that is preferred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

  <img src="images/i-064.jpg" width="483" height="300" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 31.</span>
</div>

<p>The elementary tip, that anybody may cut out of a piece
of pigskin (fig. 30), further sophisticated, became the tip registered
by Messrs. Aldred in 1868 (fig. 31) as the 'Paragon,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with the Mules-Spedding contrivance added, and also a catch,
and a strap over the nail, for keeping it in position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
  <img src="images/i-064a.jpg" width="511" height="300" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 32.</span>
</div>

<p>The <i class="term">parrot-beak</i> (fig. 32) is a further development of the
Mules-Spedding tip, with the brass bolt omitted. This is not
an improvement, as the sewing, if it suddenly failed, could
not be readily replaced.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Spedding had a further contrivance which brought
the little finger in to the assistance of the third finger. This
was managed by securing a loop to the guard for the third
finger. This loop was passed over the little finger, which was
tightly curled up towards the palm of the hand, thus supporting
the third during the strain of the aim. The little finger
was, of course, uncurled at the instant of loose.</p>

<p>Soon after 1859 Mr. H. A. Ford began to lose the almost
perfect command which he had, during about ten years, possessed
over the bow. Whether this failure arose from the use of bows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that were too strong, causing actual physical injury to some
of the muscles engaged in the action of pulling up or loosing;
or whether it arose from shooting too much; or whether it
arose from loss of nerve and confidence, through over-anxiety
to excel, and keep in front of all the opponents who, profiting
by his instruction, began to tread close upon his heels, will
never be known; but certain it is that before he reappeared
as Champion at Brighton in 1867, with his fourth best Grand
National score of 1,037 (his better scores being, 1,251 at
Cheltenham in 1857, 1,076 at Exeter in 1858, and 1,074 at
Shrewsbury in 1854), he had taken to weak bows and light
arrows, and had tried several different combinations of fingers
for loosing. Thus he contrived a finger-tip for the little finger,
to the back of which he attached the third finger, so that these
two might combine to do the work of one finger. This did not
prove successful; but he was satisfied with his final experiment,
which consisted of a tip for the first finger, on to the
back of which his second finger was also applied; and he has
been heard to declare his belief that if he could have tried
this loose in his best days he might have improved upon his
best scores.</p>

<p>Occasionally the second and third fingers are furnished
with a double-cell tip for the parallel action of these two
fingers; but as contrivances of this sort are but the playthings
of broken-down archers&mdash;of whom, alas, there are too
many&mdash;they are not mentioned with any view of recommending
them until, after patient trial, the other simpler finger-guards
have failed.</p>

<p>A piece of strong quill is sometimes sewn upon the inside
of the tip with the leather catch so as to prevent the string
from getting embedded in the leather, and to quicken the loose;
but its interference with the 'feel' of the string argues against
its employment.</p>

<p>It is even doubtful whether anything but the most cautious
use of the leather catch to the finger-tip may not be most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
dangerous. Many of the best shots do not use it; and though
no doubt the certainty of the one best position for the string
on the fingers, when the archer is at his best, will produce most
excellent results, yet, the possibility that a permanent breakdown
may be the result of the use of the same catch when the
archer is out of condition or practice, or perhaps tired, should
make every archer careful to avoid the loss of liberty of hold
that may be found advisable under varying circumstances.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER V.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF THE GREASE-BOX, TASSEL, BELT, ETC</i></span></h2>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Grease Box.</h3>

<p><i class="term">The grease-box</i> was, no doubt, an important part of an archer's
equipment when prepared for battle, as he had to be out in all
weathers, and the grease it contained could alone help him to
avoid the ill consequences of moisture about his shooting-glove.
The modern archer is seldom called upon to shoot more than,
possibly, one end in a sudden shower; and many now never
carry a grease-box at all. Yet there is no objection to its use.
It should contain vaseline, which may be occasionally applied
to the finger-guards, and to the lapping where in contact with
the fingers; also, the arrows about the footing may be greased
to prevent the paint from the target-faces adhering to them.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Tassel.</h3>

<p>He must be a good archer indeed who can dispense with
this necessary addition to his equipment. The tassel is usually
made of green worsted, and its primary use is to remove
any dirt that may adhere to the arrow when it is drawn from
the ground, but the head of it may be used for carrying a few
pins, and concealed within the outer fringe may be kept a
small piece of oiled flannel, to be applied to the arrow occasionally,
so as to prevent the paint from sticking on to the shaft.
The tassel should be of moderate dimensions&mdash;in fact, the
smaller the better, provided it be big enough for use. It is
usually hung on to a button of a gentleman's coat, but ladies
usually wear it attached to their girdles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Belt, Quiver, etc.</h3>

<p>In former days a leather belt was considered absolutely
necessary, and some have been known to consider themselves
more fully dressed for an archery contest with the green baize
bag for the bow surrounding the waist. It was certainly useful,
and kept together the various things then in use, namely,
the glove, the quiver, the tassel, the grease-box, the tablets
for scoring, the pricker for the same purpose, the armguard,
&amp;c. A well-appointed archer of the present day devotes a coat
specially for the purposes of archery, and this is fitted with a
long leather-lined pocket let into the back of the coat, to the
left of the left back-button. This pocket holds his arrows,
and becomes his quiver. The tassel is attached to a front
button. Any suitable note-book with a pencil goes into a
pocket, taking the place of the tablet and pricker. As a belt
is not the most convenient receptacle for the rest of his equipment,
no belt is carried. As ladies are not yet so well provided
with pockets as gentlemen, they still find it almost absolutely
necessary to carry a belt for their various requisites,
and some will even voluntarily (or perhaps involuntarily, in
the case of the Championess of the West) handicap themselves
by carrying the whole apparatus in solid silver.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Scoring Apparatus.</h3>

  in the St. George's Hound to be 654 from 104 hits.</div>
</div>

<p>Any ordinary note-book fitted with a pencil is by far the
best thing for keeping the correct record of an archer's score.
Very convenient scoring-books are to be bought at the archery
shops, and these contain usually the forms for York Rounds
for gentlemen, and National Rounds for ladies, to be filled up
with plain figures entered in the right places as the scores are
made. The objection to these books is that the rounds shot
are not invariably York and National rounds. That the
ingenious may be saved the trouble of re-inventing the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
scoring-apparatus of past times it is here described. A card
3-1/2 inches by 2-1/2 inches was slipped into a silver frame, which
was much like the contrivance used for direction cards for
luggage in travelling. Between the card and the back of the
silver frame was a leather pad of the same size as the card.
A pricker was used to record the score on the card, and the
leather pad protected the point of the pricker from the silver
back. The card had engraved upon it the form of the round
usually shot. The form for a York Round is here
given. The figures on the left-hand side indicate
the twelve double ends of six arrows each&mdash;72
arrows shot at 100 yards; the middle figures
indicate the eight double ends of six arrows each&mdash;48
arrows at 80 yards; and the figures on the
right-hand side indicate the four double ends at
60 yards&mdash;24 arrows. This form is now filled up
with the best York Round that Mr. H. A. Ford
ever made, as recorded by himself, and here given
in facsimile. It is believed that the wonderful
score here recorded of 809, from 137 hits, in the
York Round, was made at Cheltenham about September 4,
1855; but, through an unaccountable want of courtesy on
the part of the Ford family, the accurate date of this score
cannot be given as a fact. It is not entered in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
invented by the Rev. J. Bramhall, which indicates not only the
hits made, but also the order in which the arrows were shot.
Thus (see p. 69) say the first arrow, shot at 100 yards, hit the
red; the second was a gold, and the third a miss; the fourth
arrow was a red; the fifth was a black, and the sixth a gold.
Each set of vertical spaces for whites, blacks, blues, reds, and
golds is allotted to a double end of six arrows. The result of
the first arrow is marked on the left-hand side at the top, the
second on the left-hand side in the middle, and the third on
the left-hand side at the bottom. The same is done with the
next three arrows on the right-hand side. Of course, when
an arrow misses the target, no mark is made, and the order
of the misses is shown by the hits.</p>

<p>The incurable fault of this method of scoring by prick-marks
is that it is impossible to correct a mistake or to verify the accuracy
of scores as recorded. (Is there not the Hibernian story
of the archer who, in perfect good faith, believed that he made
seventy-three hits with seventy-two arrows at sixty yards?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
So much that was unpleasant transpired after the Crystal
Palace Meeting in 1871, that in 1872 the system of scoring
at the public meetings by means of these prick-marks in the
different colours was finally abandoned, and the scoring by
the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 introduced instead. This scoring by
figures had then already been for some years in vogue amongst
the West Kent archers, introduced by the hon. secretary,
Mr. R. B. Martin, and the members of the Royal Toxophilite
Society had mostly, for many years previously, kept their
private scores in plain figures.</p>

<p>In this method no attempt is ever made to record the
order in which the hits at any end fall; neither is it considered
advisable to do so, though it would be equally easy to
enter the figures in the same order, when known, as the hits
are made; but this is a matter of no importance.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Register.</h3>

<p>Every archer is most strongly recommended to keep a
careful and accurate record of all the shooting he does, not
only by entering in a scoring-book every arrow shot during
the day (which will act as a check to irregular and careless
practice), but also by keeping a register, or book of record, in
which the results of each day's shooting should be entered.
Those who have not been in the habit of booking all their
successes and shortcomings have no idea of the great interest
with which this record invests the most solitary practice, and
how conducive it is to its steady and persevering continuance.
It begets a great desire to improve: for no man likes to have
evidence before his eyes of his pains and exertions being of no
avail, and of himself at a standstill in any pursuit he takes an
interest in; it ensures a due carefulness in the shooting of
every arrow, since without it the score will be bad, and therefore
disagreeable to chronicle; it excites emulation, by enabling
the average of one man's shooting to be compared with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of another, and restrains by its sternly demonstrating figures
those flights of imagination occasionally indulged in by the
owners of inaccurate memories as to feats performed and
scores achieved. By taking note also in this register of the
causes of failure at different times, a lessened chance will exist
of their occurring again, as it will keep the same always in
view, and the necessity of their avoidance prominently before
the attention. In short, the archer will find the little trouble
the keeping of it occasions him so abundantly repaid in a
variety of ways, that when it is once commenced he will never
afterwards be induced to abandon its use.</p>

<p>Whilst the subject of register is under consideration the
beginner's attention should be called to the 'Archer's Register,'
edited by Mr. J. Sharpe, which is issued annually, and gives a
full account of all the public archery meetings of the previous
year, and of the doings of all the principal societies in the
kingdom.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The 'Ascham.'</h3>

<p>This term is applied to an upright narrow cupboard, contrived
for the purpose of holding all the implements of archery.
It is constructed so that the bows may stand or hang upright in
the back part, and in the front each individual arrow may stand,
also upright, and sufficiently apart from its neighbour to avoid
the possibility of any injury to the feathers. In height this
<i class="term">Ascham</i> should be upwards of six feet, so that there may be
sufficient room for the longest bows, and the bows should all,
if standing, be on a bottom raised some few inches above the
floor of the apartment, as an additional security against damp,
which is a most fatal enemy to the bow. In damp situations,
and particularly at the seaside, great care must be taken to
keep out all moisture. Also, as far as possible, a tolerably
even temperature should be maintained. The long box in
which an archer keeps his stock of bows, arrows, &amp;c., when
travelling, is also called an <i class="term">Ascham</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Targets.</h3>

<p>The backing of the <i class="term">target</i> is made of thrashed or unthrashed
straw (rye-straw is the best) firmly bound together whilst
wet with strong tarred string, and in construction is somewhat
similar to the make of beehive, only it is made flat. It
is circular, and the front of this straw <i class="term">boss</i> (as it is called),
intended for the canvas facing, is worked up with a flat surface,
so that the facing may lie upon it more evenly than it could
upon the other side. The canvas facing must also be circular,
and exactly four feet in diameter; of course the straw <i class="term">boss</i>
should also be as nearly as possible of the same size, but on
no account less. The canvas facing is divided into a central
circle of gold, surrounded by concentric rings of red, blue,
black, and white, arranged in this order of colour from the
centre outwards. The radius of the golden centre and the
breadth of each of the surrounding rings should be the same,
namely, one-fifth of four feet, i.e. four inches and four-fifths
of an inch. Each hit in these colours is valued as follows:
nine in the gold, seven in the red (formerly called scarlet),
five in the blue (still occasionally known as inner white), three
in the black, and one in the white. These figures, however,
do not correctly represent the value of the rings according to
their respective areas. The area of a circle is proportional
to the square of its radius. Therefore the area of the circle
containing the gold and red together is four times as large
as the area of the gold circle alone; and it follows that if the
gold circle be removed from this larger circle the remaining
red ring will be three times the size of the gold circle. In the
same manner, the circle containing the gold, red, and blue
will in area be nine times as large as the gold circle alone;
and if the combined gold and red circle be removed the remaining
area of the blue ring will be five times as large as
the gold. Again, the area of the circle containing the gold,
red, blue, and black will be sixteen times larger than the gold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and if the gold, red, and blue be removed, an area seven
times as large as the gold will be left for the black ring.
Finally, the entire face of the target contains an area twenty-five
times at large as the gold, and the white ring is nine
times as large as the gold. Thus we get the target divided
into twenty-five parts, of which one part is gold, three parts
are red, five are blue, seven are black, and nine are white. But
it does not correctly follow that, nine being taken to represent
the value of a hit in the gold, and one as the value of a hit in
the white (because the white ring is nine times larger than
the gold circle), a hit in the red ring should count as seven, a
hit in the blue as five, and a hit in the black as three. The
proportion of the areas between the white and black rings is
as nine to seven, giving the value of 1-2/7 for each hit in the
black, or 1.28571 in decimals. Similarly, the proportion of
area between the white and blue rings is as nine to five, giving
the value of 1-4/5, or 1.8, as the value of each hit in the blue
circle. The proportion of the area between the white and the
red rings is as nine to three, giving the value of three for each
hit in the red ring.</p>

<p>It may be taken that these values of 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, representing
the hits in gold, red, blue, black, and white, are the
best that can be adopted, and in their sum represent the
twenty-five parts, the size of the gold, into which the target
may be supposed to be divided.</p>

<p>There appears to be no exaggeration of the value of the
gold as compared with the white, and the exaggerated value of
the other colours very properly rewards superior skill, as shown
by central hitting of the target.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>In the days when handicapping was done by taking off
rings instead of percentages it might have been better to
reduce the values of these reds, blues, and blacks when made
by the more skilful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The old exploded custom of adding hits to score was only a
roundabout method of reducing the values of the hits from
9, 7, 5, 3, 1 to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>

<p>Targets are now all made of the same size, as already
mentioned; but for many years after the revival of archery in
1781 four-feet targets were only used at the long distances of
120, 100, and 90 yards, whilst targets of three feet and two
feet in diameter were used at the shorter distances and by
ladies. In still older times our modern target-practice was
represented by what was called the <i class="term">Paper Game</i>, from paper
being employed instead of the oil-painted canvas now in use.</p>

<p>It was an old fashion to score in money, thus: a gold was
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, a scarlet 2<i>s.</i>, an inner white 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, a black 1<i>s.</i>, and
a white 6<i>d.</i>; and this is still the custom with the Woodmen
of Arden, whose members still receive in cash at the end of
a prize meeting the total value of their scores. The same
custom also prevails at the Annual Scorton Arrow Meeting,
except that each archer pays 6<i>d.</i> into the pool for every hit he
makes in the white.</p>

<p>Formerly, unless an arrow was entirely in one colour, it
was counted as a hit in the inferior of the two colours between
which its position was divided; but now, except with the
Woodmen of Arden, the contrary custom prevails, and the
arrow will count as a hit in the superior colour, unless it be
quite surrounded by the inferior colour. It is right that the
archer should have the benefit of any doubt in this matter.</p>

<p>The purchasers of targets should ascertain that they have
well-painted and well-seasoned facings. The American-cloth
facings sometimes to be met with are most unsatisfactory, and
occasionally there is too much of a sticky compound laid on
the facings previous to the paint, which adheres to the arrow,
and helps to denude the target of colour.</p>

<p>It is not generally acknowledged that the colours of the
target at present in use are well adapted for most accurate
shooting. They are too bright and glaring, confusing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
eye, and drawing the attention away from the centre, so that
it is most difficult to avoid aiming at the target generally,
rather than the gold. Now that the scoring is kept in figures,
and no longer in colours, there would be no difficulty in substituting
other colours that would assist to concentrate the
aim, if only a general agreement about the nature of the
change could be arrived at.</p>

<p>The usual custom of fixing targets is, that the centre of
the gold shall be four feet from the ground, and as the target
is always sloped with its lower part advanced towards the
shooter, it follows that the correct distance of the bottom of
the target from the ground is a trifle more than two feet and
one inch.</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Target-Stands.</h3>

<p>The most usual <i class="term">target-stands</i> are of iron, in three pieces,
each of about six feet in length, hinged together at the top,
and painted green, forming a tripod for the support of the
target, which is caught on to it by a hooked spike at the top
of the stand, and kept from shifting its position thereon by a
spike about half way up each of the front legs. These stands
are so destructive to any arrows that hit them, even through
the targets, that, for home use, they should be padded in
front with a strip of thick felt, secured with strong twine, and
then carefully wrapped with strong binding and painted.</p>

<p>The late Mr. James Spedding first invented this method
of covering the stands which he had made for the Royal Toxophilite
Society, of three long ash poles, united together at the
top with iron nutted screw-bolts. When the stand is so treated
it is almost impossible that an arrow can be injured by contact
with the stand, and the extra expense (which is, however, considerable)
is soon saved by the saving in arrows at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
apiece.</p>

<p>The Meyler stand, a very expensive machine, was a strong
iron arm, fitted into a metal socket fixed in the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
at the upper end provided with three prongs, upon which the
target was fixed; but it possessed the same incurable fault as
the old earthen butts, in that it was immovable (except to the
places where the necessary sockets were).</p>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">The Quiver.</h3>

<p>The tin <i class="term">quiver</i>, made in different sizes to contain six, a
dozen, or more arrows, with sometimes a receptacle at the
top for spare strings, wax, thread, silk, file, &amp;c., is too handy
an article to be ever altogether discarded, though the arrows
in it do occasionally suffer by being indiscriminately jumbled
together. The arrow-boxes of wood now made to hold different
quantities of arrows are, of course, to be preferred. But the
best receptacle for arrows on a journey is a properly fitted
compartment in the bow-box, and the method invented by the
Rev. J. M. Croker is the best of all. This is fitted with a
hinge, so that any arrow in it can be removed without shifting
any of the others.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER VI.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF BRACING, OR STRINGING, AND NOCKING</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">In the previous chapters such plain directions have been
given concerning the various implements of archery as will
enable each archer to provide himself with the best of the kind
that his inclinations or means may lead him to adopt, and to
enable him to avoid such as are in themselves radically bad,
or likely to add to the difficulties he is sure to meet with
before arriving at any great or satisfactory proficiency in the
art. Having been thus enabled to form a choice as to his
weapons, he must now be guided in their use; and, in the
first place, there are a few minor matters that cannot be
altogether passed over in silence. The first of these is the
<i class="term">bracing</i> or <i class="term">stringing</i> of a bow, which may be considered as
the first preliminary operation to actual shooting. This is
the act of <i class="term">bending</i> the bow, when unstrung, sufficiently to
enable the archer to slip the upper <i class="term">eye</i> of the string into the
<i class="term">nock</i> of the upper horn. To effect this, the usual method is
to set the lower horn of the bow (its back being turned towards
the archer) on the ground, against the inside of the right foot,
this being turned a little inward so as to prevent the horn
from slipping out of place. Then, the handle being firmly
grasped with the right hand, and the lower or wrist-part of
the left hand being rested upon the upper limb of the bow
a few inches below the upper eye of the string, a strong
steady pull must be applied with the right hand at the handle
(the left hand and right foot forming the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">points d'appui</i>) so
that the bow may be bent, whilst the thumb and second joint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the first finger, or preferably the tips of the first and
second fingers of the left hand, carry the eye of the string into
the nock. Novices must be particularly careful that they do
not get either of the fingers entangled between the string and
the bow.</p>

<p>In stringing the bow, it is quite unimportant whether it
be held in the right or left hand; but if the finger-tips be
worn on the right hand, it is better to use this hand for the
purpose of grasping the bow, rather than for helping the eye
of the string into its place.</p>

<p>To unstring the bow, the action is the same as in the final
position of stringing it, except that the eye of the string is
slipped out of the horn.</p>

<p>To string and unstring a bow gracefully and without
apparent effort is an affair rather of knack than of much
strength or force, and is therefore only to be learnt with a
certain amount of practice. The archer must keep, as far as
possible, an upright position, as to crouch over the operation
is ungainly, and interferes with the satisfactory application of
the necessary amount of effort.</p>

<p>The bow being now strung, two things must be carefully
noted: first, that the bend of the bow be neither too much
nor too little; and secondly, that the string starts from both
horns exactly at the centre of each&mdash;i.e. no atom either to
the right or left, but dividing the bow precisely in half from
end to end. If this latter caution be not observed the grain
of the bow runs considerable risk of being unnaturally strained,
and the bow itself of being pulled away and out of its proper
shape, and sooner or later breaking in consequence. It is
even possible that the correct cast itself may be more or less
disadvantageously affected by any carelessness on this point.
This is one of the many minutiæ of archery, which is of
more importance than may at first sight appear, and should
always be attended to before the bow is allowed to discharge a
single arrow. During the shooting, too, attention should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
occasionally directed to the string, to observe whether the loop
may not have slipped a little away, as it may sometimes
unavoidably do. If a second eye has been added to the string
in the place of the loop, the string will be much more easily
adjusted, and then there will be no fear of its getting away
during the shooting. As regards the first point&mdash;namely, the
amount of bend in a bow when strung&mdash;it has been already
stated that in a man's bow the distance of the inside of the
handle from the string should scarcely ever be less than six
inches. The advantages of having the bow low-strung are
that the bow casts quicker and farther (owing to the greater
length the arrow is acted upon by the string), and that the
bow, and also the string, are less strained, and consequently
in less danger of breaking; but to be balanced against these
advantages is the fact that the danger of striking the armguard
before the extreme point of the string's recoil (already
shown to be fatal to accurate shooting) is greater, and the
cast may be somewhat less steady.</p>

<p>It has been immemorially customary to ascertain the
amount of the bend of the bow when strung, by placing the
fist upright upon the inside of the handle (at the centre of
the bow), at the same time raising up the thumb towards the
string; if the string then just touches the extremity of the
thumb the bracing is supposed to be tolerably correct. This
is not, however, an infallible test, as the size of hands
of different individuals varies considerably; but each archer
can ascertain how far his own hand, placed in the above way,
varies from the old-fashioned measure of six inches, known as
a <i class="term">fistmele</i>, and, bearing this constantly in mind, may ascertain
the bracing of his bow as accurately as if his own fistmele
were the exact six inches.</p>

<p>The <i class="term">nocking</i> of the arrow must now be considered. This
is the application of the nock of the arrow to its proper place
on the string. Simple as this operation may at first sight
appear, yet there is a right way and a wrong way of doing it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and as the wrong way leads to the injury and disfigurement
of the bow, let the beginner acquire the right method at first,
as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The bow being held somewhat downwards by the handle
with the left hand, with the string upwards, let the arrow be
placed with the right hand <i>over</i> the string (not on any account
<i>under</i> the string, as this latter method of nocking is sure to
lead sooner or later to the disfigurement of the belly of the
bow, by numerous stabs inflicted upon it by the sharp point
of the arrow) upon that part of the bow (close to the forefinger
of the left hand) upon which it is to lie; the thumb of the left
hand (not the forefinger) being then gently placed over it will
serve to hold it perfectly under command, whilst the forefinger
and thumb of the right hand take hold of the nock end of the
arrow, and manipulate with perfect ease the application of the
<i class="term">nock</i> to the proper <i class="term">nocking-place</i> on the string. Five minutes'
practice will suffice to render this method of nocking easy and
familiar. But if the archer be afraid of unsteadying his hold
upon the handle of the bow by shifting his left thumb on to
the arrow, as above described, let him hold the arrow with his
right hand just above the feathers, and so apply the nock
to the string without assistance from the left thumb. This
method is, however, somewhat more awkward-looking.</p>

<p>The centre of the nocking-place should be exactly upon
that point of the string which is opposite to the spot on the
bow over which the arrow will pass when shot&mdash;i.e. the arrow
when nocked must be precisely perpendicular to the string.
If the arrow be nocked at a lower point, it will beat itself
against the forefinger of the left hand, and thereby waste some
of the energy that should be applied to its flight. On the
other hand, if the arrow be nocked at a higher point, the
drawing will be commenced from a point not contemplated in
the manufacture of the bow when the compensated strength
of the upper and lower limbs is arranged for a fulcrum not
exactly central. Care must be taken that the nocking-part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the string exactly fits or fills the nock of the arrow. The hold
of the nock upon the string must be neither too tight nor too
loose; if the first, the nock may, and probably will, be split;
and if the second, the shaft is apt to slip whilst in the act of
being drawn, and the nock will be broken, or the correct elevation
and proper flight of the arrow will be lost.</p>

<p>A word of warning must be added for the young archer
against attempting to alter the range of his arrow by varying
the nocking-place. For the reasons above given, a worse system
could not be adopted.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER VII.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF ASCHAM'S FIVE POINTS, POSITION STANDING, ETC.</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The various implements of archery having been now described,
the proper use of these by the archer claims attention.</p>

<p>Roger Ascham stated in 1545 that 'fayre shootynge came
of these thynges: of standynge, nockynge, drawynge, howldynge,
and lowsynge'; and these his well-known <i>five points of
archery</i> have been followed by most other writers on the subject
in this same order. He has set out so well 'all the discommodities
whiche ill custome hath grafted in archers' that
'can neyther be quycklye poulled out, nor yet sone reckened
of me, they be so manye,' that it will be excusable to quote
them for the benefit of beginners, for their avoidance before
they have been acquired.</p>

<p>'Some shooteth his head forwarde, as though he woulde
byte the marke; an other stareth wyth hys eyes, as though
they shoulde flye out; another winketh with one eye, and
looketh with the other. Some make a face with writhing
theyr mouthe and countenance so; another blereth out his
tonge; another byteth his lyppes; another holdeth his neck a
wrye. In drawynge some set suche a compasse, as thoughe
they woulde tourne about and blysse all the feelde; other
heaue theyr hand nowe vp, nowe downe, that a man cannot
decerne wherat they wolde shote; another waggeth the
vpper ende of his bow one way, the neyther ende an other
waye. An other wil stand poyntinge his shafte at the marke
a good whyle, and by-and-by he wyll gyue a whip, and awaye,
or a man wite. An other maketh suche a wrestling with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
gere, as thoughe he were able to shoote no more as longe as
he lyued. Another draweth softly to ye middes, and by-and-by
it is gon, you cannot knowe howe.</p>

<p>'Another draweth his shafte lowe at the breaste, as thoughe
he woulde shoote at a rouynge marke, and by-and-by he lifteth
his arme vp pricke heyghte. Another maketh a wrynching
with hys back as though a manne pynched hym behynde.</p>

<p>'Another coureth downe, as though he shoulde shoote at
crowes.</p>

<p>'Another setteth forwarde hys lefte legge, and draweth backe
with head and showlders, as though he pouled at a rope, or
els were afrayed of the marke. Another draweth his shafte
well vntyll wythin ii fyngers of the head, and then stayeth to
looke at hys marke, and that done pouleth it vp to the head,
and lowseth; whiche waye, although summe excellent shoters
do use, yet surely it is a faulte, and good mennes faultes are
not to be followed.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>'Summe men drawe to farre, summe to shorte, summe to
slowlye, summe to quickely, summe holde over longe, summe
let go over sone.</p>

<p>'Summe sette theyr shafte on the grounde, and fetcheth
him vpwarde. Another poynteth vp towarde the skye, and so
bryngeth hym downewardes.</p>

<p>'Ones I sawe a manne whyche used a brasar on his cheke,
or elles he had scratched all the skynne of the one syde of his
face with his drawynge hand.</p>

<p>'An other I sawe, whiche at everye shoote, after the loose,
lyfteth vp his ryght legge so far that he was ever in ieopardye
of faulyng.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
'Summe stampe forwarde, and summe leape backwarde.
All these faultes be eyther in the drawynge or at the loose;
with many other mo, whiche you may easelye perseyue, and
so go about to auoyde them.</p>

<p>'Now afterwardes, when the shafte is gone, men haue
manye faultes, which euell custome hath broughte them to,
and specially in cryinge after the shafte and speakynge woordes
scarce honest for suche an honest pastyme.</p>

<p>'And besyde those whiche must nedes have theyr tongue
thus walkynge, other men vse other fautes: as some will take
theyr bowe and writhe and wrinche it, to poule in his shafte when
it flyeth wyde, as yf he draue a carte. Some wyll gyue two or
iii strydes forwarde, daunsing and hoppynge after his shafte, as
long as it flyeth, as though he were a madman. Some which
feare to be to farre gone, runne backewarde as it were to poule
his shafte backe. Another runneth forwarde when he feareth
to be short, heauynge after his armes, as though he woulde
helpe his shafte to flye. An other writhes or runneth a syde to
poule in his shafte strayght. One lifteth up his heele, and so
holdeth his foote still, as longe as his shafte flyeth. Another
casteth his arme backewarde after the lowse. An other swynges
his bowe aboute hym, as if it were a man with a staffe to
make roume in a game place. And manye other faultes there
be, whiche nowe come not to my remembraunce. Thus, as you
have hearde, manye archers wyth marrynge theyr face and
countenaunce wyth other partes of theyr bodye, as it were menne
that shoulde daunce antiques, be farre from the comelye porte
in shootynge whiche he that woulde be excellent muste looke
for.'</p>

<p>He then frankly confesses that, though teaching others 'of
these faultes, I have verie manye my selfe; but I talk not of
my shootynge, but of the generall nature of shootyng. Now
ymagin an archer that is clean, wythout all these faultes, and
I am sure euerye man woulde be delyghted to se hym shoote.'</p>

<p>Another will suddenly crouch down on his hams, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
though he were marking a bird's flight to pluck it down, or it
were out of sight.</p>

<p>'Another will call himself uncomely names, whilst another
casteth away his bow as though he would break it for faultes
that are his own; and yet another will treat himself at faulte
with such harsh usage that he shall scarce shoot again without
black eyes for manye a daie.'</p>

<p>As the term <i class="term">standing</i> seems insufficient to include all that
has to be said respecting the attitude and general bearing
of the archer whilst in the act of shooting, the expression
<i class="term">position</i> is adopted instead, as more applicable and comprehensive,
and under <i class="term">position</i> will be included, not only the
footing or standing, but also the manner in which the hand
should grasp the bow, and therefore, as well, the exact position
of the bow itself.</p>

<p>In an endeavour to lay down such plain directions as may
prevent the assumption of attitudes inimical to good shooting,
and as may also assist in the avoidance of such other attitudes
as do violence to gracefulness and are repulsive to the
looker-on, it would be venturing too far to assert that but <i>one</i>
position is good, or even that any particular <i>one</i> is the best;
yet some general rules can with sufficient confidence be laid
down for the purpose of controlling mannerisms and of confining
them within harmless limits.</p>

<p>As regards the footing or standing and the attitudes of
archers, it may be safely asserted that there are as many
varieties as there are archers to call them into existence; that
no two are exactly alike in all particulars; and that no one
archer has yet been seen to combine all the excellences that
might be centred in a perfect archer.</p>

<p>That an archer's general position may be a good one it
must possess three qualities&mdash;firmness, elasticity, and grace:
<i class="term">firmness</i>, to resist the strain and the recoil of the bow&mdash;for if
there be any wavering or unsteadiness the shot will probably
prove a failure; <i class="term">elasticity</i>, to give free play to the muscles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and the needful command over them&mdash;which cannot be the
case should the position be too rigid and stiff; and <i class="term">grace</i>, to
render the archer and his performance agreeable, and not ludicrous,
to the spectator. It so far, fortunately, happens that
the third requirement&mdash;that of grace&mdash;is almost a necessary
consequence of the possession of the other two: as the best
position for practical results is, in fact, the most graceful one.
Experience proves that an awkward ungainly style of shooting
is very seldom successful. All these three requisites must be
kept constantly in mind in every endeavour to arrive at the
best position for combining them.</p>

<p>To the first part of position&mdash;that of <i class="term">footing</i>, or <i class="term">standing</i>&mdash;but
little can be added to what has already been recommended
in other books on the subject.</p>

<p>The heels should be, not close together, but about six or
eight inches apart&mdash;thus avoiding the position that gives too
little steadfastness in a wind in the one extreme, and an ungainly
straddle in the other. The feet must be firmly planted
on the ground, symmetrically, so as to form an angle of from
45° to 60° by the joining of the lines passing through the feet
behind the heels. As regards the position of the heels with reference
to the target to be shot at, undoubtedly the best position is
that in which a line through the centres of the heels points to the
centre of the target (fig. 34); but as many good shots have
modified this position in the one or other direction, it may be
allowed that any position of the feet&mdash;varying from that in
which a line through the left or forward foot is at right angles
to the line from the shooter's eye to the centre of the target
(fig. 35) to that in which the line through the right foot is at
right angles to the same line towards the target (fig. 36) (an
extreme variation of 60°)&mdash;may be adopted without extreme
violence to either freedom of action or grace. The fault of
tipping forward towards the target shot at, caused by throwing
the balance unduly upon the forward foot, may be cured
by raising the heel of that foot. This is by no means an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
uncommon fault, and should be carefully guarded against as
very fatal to shooting, and liable to result in most ridiculous
developments. As the opposite fault has almost overtaken
some of the best shots, it may be classed amongst exaggerated
virtues, and is little likely to embarrass beginners. The legs
should be perfectly straightened at the knees, and not on any
account bent forward; and yet the knees should not be so
rigidly locked back as to interfere with the elasticity of the
position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i-088.jpg" width="400" height="349" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span> &nbsp; <span class="smcap in4">Fig. 35.</span> &nbsp; <span class="smcap in4">Fig. 36.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that in fig. 34 only, the left and right
shoulders, at points <span class="smcap small">A</span> and <span class="smcap small">B</span> respectively, come naturally into
the best position for shooting at the target; but by adopting
the position shown in fig. 36, a full-bodied archer may be
enabled to draw a trifle further before the bowstring comes in
contact with the chest; whilst in the position shown in fig. 35<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
an archer of supple figure can easily get the shoulders into
the best position in the course of drawing up.</p>

<p>The body should be naturally upright, but not stiff; the
whole person well balanced; and the face turned round so as
to be nearly fronting the target.</p>

<p>During the brief period of time between the nocking of the
arrow (already described in pp. 80-2) and the loosing of it,
some slight alteration of the body's attitude, as arranged when
the archer assumes his footing, will take place, as in the combined
act of drawing and aiming, the right shoulder will be
brought a little forward, and the left shoulder will be taken
a little backward, before the shoulders resume their former
relative positions previous to the loose, which in that position
only can be most advantageously executed. The slightest
possible inclination forward should be given to the head and
chest, that the arrow may be brought directly under the right
or aiming eye, without bringing the line of aim so close to the
line through the left shoulder and bow as to make it impossible
that the string can clear the forearm at the loose.</p>

<p>Many archers bend the body considerably forward from
the waist, and quote the following passage from Bishop
Latimer's sixth sermon&mdash;My father 'taught me how to drawe,
how to lay my bodye in my bowe, and not to drawe with
strength of armes, as other nacions do, but with strength of
bodye'&mdash;in justification of this practice. Here, laying the
body in the bow means taking up the best position for shooting.
An archer in olden times was said to shoot <i>in</i> a bow,
not <i>with</i> a bow.</p>

<p>'Not stooping, nor yet standing straight upright,' as
Nicholl's 'London Artillery' hath it, expresses the right position
correctly.</p>

<p>The second part of <i class="term">position</i> which is most, important also,
is the manner in which the hand should grasp the bow, and
the attitude of the bow itself&mdash;i.e. whether this should be
vertical, or more or less oblique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
It may be stated at once that the most natural and easy
method of grasping the bow is also the best; in fact this
remark is applicable to almost every point connected with
archery, and cannot be too much or too often insisted upon.
If the wrist and hand be in any way unnaturally employed
bad results immediately follow. For instance, if the grasp be
such as to throw the fulcrum much below the centre of the
bow, its lower limb runs great risk of being pulled away and
out of shape, which sooner or later will cause it to chrysal or
break. Again, the Waring method, which used to be in high
favour, 'of turning the wrist in as much possible,' causes the
left arm to be held in such a straightened position, that it will
not only present a constantly recurring obstacle and diverting
influence to the free passage of the string, but will also be the
cause of an increased strain and additional effort to the shooter,
besides taking the spring and elasticity out of that all-important
member the bow-arm. If the reverse of this method be
adopted, and the wrist be turned intentionally and unnaturally
outwards, it will be found that in avoiding Scylla Charybdis is
at hand, and, though the string is well clear of the armguard,
the wrist cannot sustain either the strain of the bow at full
stretch or its recoil at the loose. Thus, as in every other
instance, the extremes are bad, and the correct position will
be found at the balancing-point between them.</p>

<p>When the <i class="term">footing</i> has been taken, with the arrow nocked,
let the bow lie easily and lightly in the left hand, the wrist
being turned neither inwards nor outwards, but allowed to
remain in the position most easy and natural for it; as the
drawing of the bow commences, the grasp will intuitively
tighten, and by the time the arrow is drawn to the head
the position of the hand and wrist will be such as to be
easiest for the shooter and best for the success of his shot.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed in the three figures giving the correct
and wrong positions of the hand on the bow-handle, that the
upper part of the bow hand, including the whole of the thumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and first finger, is above the upper line of the wrist (line <span class="smcap small">AB</span>),
whilst the fulcrum, or working centre of the bow, is also above
that line, or even in such bows as have their centres in the
middle of the handle but little below that line. It is pretty clear
that if the hand had been originally constructed solely with a
view to its application to the bow, or even as a weapon in the
noble art of self-defence, it might have been constructed so as
to be a more evenly-balanced hammer at the end of its handle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the arm, than it is at present. Possibly its narrow escape
from being another foot has interfered with its proper development
from an archer's point of view. However this may be,
it would be better, as a mechanical contrivance, for drawing a
bow, if the strain applied by the loosing hand could pass directly
along the line through the centre of the arm, with centre or
fulcrum of the bow in the same line&mdash;i.e. in line <i>a b</i> (fig. 38).</p>

<p>The nearest approach to this condition of a perfect archer's
hand was possessed by Mr. G. Edwards, the first archer to
displace Mr. H. A. Ford from the position of Champion, in
1860, who, though he may never have made the extraordinary
scores credited to Mr. Ford, was an excellent shot, and,
when at his best, had the steadiest bow-arm and the firmest
grip ever seen on a bow. Through a gun accident, he lost
entirely his left thumb, and held his bow with his four
fingers, pressing it against a leather pad inserted between the
bow and his wrist, much in the position the thumb would
occupy if it could be placed downwards across the palm of
the hand. This altered formation shifted the position of his
arm so that the line through the fulcrum of the bow was well
below the upper line of his wrist.</p>

<p>Some archers acquire the habit of extending the thumb
upwards along the belly of the bow. This method of grasping
the bow tends to weaken and unsteady the drawing power, but
as a point of drill for the acquisition of such a grasp of the
bow with the fingers, before the thumb is placed in position
to assist, as will enable the archer to clear his armguard, its
trial is strongly recommended. A steadier hold of the bow is
in the end obtained by keeping the upper part of the thumb off
the bow, so that the hold is between the root of the thumb and
the fingers. As the first finger is often used to assist in adjusting
the position of the arrow on the bow, care must be taken to
replace it at the commencement of the draw. Unless the bow
be held firmly between the four fingers and the thumb and heel
of the hand, at the loose and recoil an unpleasant jar will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
felt, with the further ill-consequence of blisters, &amp;c. The
position of the bow should be straight across the palm of
the hand, so that the fingers when closed in position to hold
it lie as nearly as possible at right angles to the axis of the
bow.</p>

<p>A lateral projection on the left side of the handle of the
bow is sometimes added, if the archer's hand be hollow,
and this contrivance assists the bowstring to avoid the armguard.</p>

<p>Before the consideration of the final position of the bow at
the loose, as to whether it should be vertical or oblique, a
glance must be taken at the horizontal position which should
be adopted by all those who disbelieve in the possibility of
aiming with bow and arrow whilst the arrow is discharged
from the side of the bow, because in that position the arrow
cannot be thrown to the left of the mark aimed at. This
position is so cramped and awkward as to be practically useless
for shooting at a horizontal aim, when a full-length arrow
cannot be drawn up, as the string comes too soon in contact
with the left side. Yet archers have been known to make
successful scores in this style, using weak bows and light
arrows.</p>

<p>The vertical position of the bow (but not as sometimes
adopted, when the bow is thus set up at the end of a horizontal
arm to be hauled at until the beginner's arrow is discharged)
is an assistance in clearing the bowstring from the chest when
a full-length arrow is fully drawn; and a tendency towards
this position at the instant of loose will correct the curious
habit many archers acquire of throwing the upper limb of the
bow down and the lower limb up after the loose, as if part of
the loosing or drawing action had been a mutually antagonistic
screw between the holding and loosing hands.</p>

<p>The chief advantage of the oblique position is that the
arrow is not so likely to be blown away from its contact with

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER VIII.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>DRAWING</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">Ascham seems to be right in declaring that 'Drawyne <i>well</i>
is the best parte of shootyng'; and, as it is in the course of
this part of the act of shooting that all the ridiculous antics
already quoted may be exhibited, and without drawing well it
is almost impossible to <i class="term">take aim</i> or <i class="term">loose</i> with any chance of
success, every archer must pay the utmost attention to the
acquisition of the best and easiest method of drawing. Yet
it is not pretended that there is but one best method of
drawing.</p>

<p>Here two things have to be previously considered, namely,
the strength of the bow to be used, and the length of the arrow,
or rather how much of its length must be drawn up. First,
as regards the strength of bow to be used, it should be observed
that when, in modern times, the practice of shooting isolated
arrows was discontinued in favour of three arrows shot by
each archer consecutively at each end throughout a York
Round, the possibility of making the delivery of each arrow
a supreme effort became impossible, and the more frequent
repetition of an effort, which, though considerable (as it should
always be), is not quite a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i>, is now accepted as more
likely to exhibit grace in the execution and accuracy in the
result, with the natural consequence that the average strength
of bows now in use is scarcely so great as it used to be;
though it must not be lost sight of that bows now are more
accurately weighed, than they were before the invention of
the York and National Rounds; and also that now a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
proportion of archers pull their arrows well up, hold, and aim
with them, whereas none did so in the old times when no
archer had so much as dreamed that it was possible to take
an aim with bows and arrows. Yet still at any public archery
meeting it is easy to observe, in one or other of the many
varieties of style of drawing represented, the germs of all
possible contortions; but in nearly all these cases of contortion
it will be found that the 'very head and front of the
offending' is in the archer's vain attempt to employ a bow
that is beyond his control; whilst, if the weapon be well within
his control, it is as needless to distort even a muscle of the
face as it is for a short-sighted person to make a grimace when
fixing the glass in his eye. Still it will also be a mistake to
be under-bowed with a plaything, as wasting part of the power
of covering distance and overcoming wind, &amp;c. Whilst bows
varying in measure from 40 lbs. to 56 lbs. and arrows varying
in weight from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> can be easily procured, every archer's
weakness or strength can be appropriately suited. For ladies
there is the range in strength of bows from 20 lbs. to 35 lbs.,
and in weight of arrows from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Next as regards the length of arrow to be drawn at each
discharge. The variation in the arrows themselves may be
only from 26 to 29 inches in those of men, and from 24 to 26
inches in those of ladies; but there is a much wider variation
in the part of the arrow drawn up by different archers. There
appears to be a widespread belief that in olden times the
archer soldiers used arrows a yard long; but only a few archers
participate in this belief, and join in treating this as a proof
of the degeneracy of modern archers. Ascham, in his treatment
of the subject of arrows, mentions them of many different
lengths and thicknesses, without any precision, and no doubt
they were much more various in his time than now. The
'clothyard' or the 'clothier's yard,' not the standard yard, is
almost always mentioned by old writers when treating of the
length of draw employed by English archers; and many considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
(supposing positive proof to be altogether wanting)
point to the conclusion that this 'clothyard' was the length
of 27 inches. In the absence of any representative surviving
war-arrow the evidence of an ancient model may be taken,
and such a model exists in the possession of the Royal Toxophilite
Society, described thus in 'A History of the Royal
Toxophilite Society 1870.' 'The most ancient piece of plate
possessed by the Society is an arrow, 28-1/4 inches long, the
"stele" being of iron very thickly plated with silver, and the
barbed pile (1-1/4 inch long), of solid silver. The three feathers
are also of solid silver. On the "stele" are these inscriptions:</p>

<div class="container-center"><div class="container-left p1">
<span class="in2 smcap">Sir Reginald Foster</span>, Kt. and Bart.<br />
<span class="in2 smcap">Warwick Ledgingham</span>, Esq.<br />
<span class="in8"><i>Stewards in Finsbury.</i></span><br />
Anno Dom. 1663.
</div></div>

<p class="in0 p2">This arrow was presented to the Society by Mr. Philip Constable.'
This Mr. Philip Constable is mentioned as one of
the oldest Finsbury archers in Dailies Barrington's essay on
Archery in the seventh volume of 'Archæologia.' The ancient
Scorton arrow (1672) is of no greater length, but has been
broken and repaired and has no date on it. There is an
act of Parliament (Irish?) 5 Edward IV. ch. 4, which provides
that every Englishman, and Irishman dwelling with
Englishmen, and speaking English, being between sixteen
and sixty years of age, shall have an English bow of his own
length, and a fistmele at least between the nocks, and <i>twelve
shafts of the length of three-quarters of the standard</i>. This
points to the length of 27 inches as the regulation length
for the stele of an arrow. The danger of breaking a bow
increases the further it is drawn up, and there is no scarcity
of bows that are broken at even a shorter draw than 27 or
28 inches. How many more broken bows would there have
been then if the usual length of arrows drawn were 36 inches;
and this in the course of a battle, when a broken bow meant
an archer temporarily disabled, as an archer? The material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
used in the manufacture of bows, the wood, must have been
the same as now, and, from the specimens extant, their length
does not appear to have been much beyond those now in use.
In fact, the length of a bow must always be limited so as to
be within the reach of the archer who strings it, and the
average stature of the human race does not appear to have
diminished.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that no arrows were longer than 27
inches. Doubtless long and light arrows were employed to annoy
an enemy whilst still at a distance; but for a war-arrow,
with a heavy barbed pile, to be an effective missile, it must have
been provided with a strong and stiff stele, and this cannot
also have been unusually long.</p>

<p>As dictionaries seem to avoid the compound words <i class="term">clothyard</i>
and <i class="term">clothier's yard</i>, no better evidence can be found than
the statement that the 27 inches constitute a Flemish yard,
and that Flemish bows, arrows, and strings were always
in high repute. So the dispute must still be left for further
consideration.</p>

<p>Hansard, in 'The Book of Archery,' 1840, treats the matter
as fully as possible perhaps, and apparently leans towards the
belief that the tallest and most stalwart archers may have
drawn up huge bows a full yard of the standard; yet, as he
contends, at p. 191, that 'great numbers of Welsh served at
Crecy and Poictiers, and it is somewhere said that a considerable
portion consisted of archers,' it seems unlikely that at the
same time the average archer at those battles was of gigantic
stature. Ascham might have settled the matter, but he
ventures no further than the statement (p. 87 of Arber's reprint)
that 'at the battel of Agincourt with vii thousand fyghtynge
men, and yet many of them sycke, beynge suche archers,
<i>as the Cronycle</i> sayeth, that mooste parte of them drewe a
yarde,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Apart from the historical consideration of what used to
be the average draw of the old English archers, it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
admitted that modern archers err on the side of not pulling up
enough rather than on the side of overdrawing. Therefore it
is strongly recommended to every archer to employ as long an
arrow as he can conveniently use, and to bear in mind that
the portion of it to be drawn up at each loose should bear some
reasonable proportion to the length of arm, &amp;c., in each individual
case. It may be safely stated that no archer will find
that he can conveniently draw fully up and loose evenly an
<i>arrow of greater length</i> than the space between the left centre
joint of the collarbone and the knuckle of the left-hand index-finger
when the bow-arm is fully extended.</p>

<p>But few experienced archers now extend the bow-arm fully
and take their aim before they commence drawing at all.
Neither can this method be commended, as it has an awkward
appearance, from the necessity that exists of stretching the
other arm so far across the body in order to reach the string,
and it materially increases the exertion necessary to pull the
bow. Yet this method is not without its use as a preliminary
drill for a beginner, that he may learn the necessity and the
difficulty of drawing his arrow up, whilst keeping it constantly
and exactly on the line which the arrow is afterwards to follow
towards the object to be hit when it is loosed; at the same
time not yet attending to the second and equally great difficulty
of a beginner, namely, that of shooting the exact length
as well; also that he may learn how to cover different lengths
by higher and lower positions of the bow-hand.</p>

<p>Much diversity of opinion exists as to the best method of
getting the bow-hand into position for the aim and loose, as to
whether, in the course of drawing up, the arrow shall be brought
into the line of aim from below or from above, or from the right
to the left; and here it would seem that to make the motion of
drawing from the right to the left and upwards at the same
time is the simplest and most direct plan, since, after the
nocking of the arrow, the drawing commences most naturally
from beneath and to the right of the object to be hit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
There seem to be three successful methods of drawing&mdash;namely,
first, to draw the arrow home<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> at once, loosing when
it has been aimed, without any further draw; secondly, to
draw the arrow within an inch or a little more of home,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> aiming
then, and loosing after the completion of the draw; and thirdly,
the method of combining the operations of drawing and aiming
so continuously that the loose is the uninterrupted completion
of the draw. It is unnecessary to consider the distinct method
of drawing up and letting out again before the loose, or the
uncertain method of fraying up and down, or playing as it
were at fast-and-loose a bit before the loose, as no archer
would adopt any such uncertain style as a matter of choice;
though such stuttering and hiccoughing performances may
occasionally bring back an erring arrow to its duty, or may
arise from the loss of nerve and the departure of the crisp
finish from what was once steady and unhesitating. Any
movement of the bow-hand in drawing up from the left towards
the right should be avoided, as that movement tends to contract
instead of expanding the chest; therefore great care
should be taken, when lateral movement is used in drawing
up, to avoid passing the line of aim in moving the bow-hand
towards the left.</p>

<p>Though the theory and practice of aiming will be fully
treated in another chapter, some reference must here be made
to <i class="term">aiming</i>, although it may lead to apparently unnecessary repetition.
Reference has already, somewhat prematurely, been
made to the <i class="term">line of aim</i>, and also to the <i class="term">length</i> to be shot. Now
it is clear that the success of a scientific shot must be the
result of the exact combinations of the <i class="term">right line of aim</i>, and
the correct <i class="term">level</i> of the bow- and loosing-hands by which to
attain the <i class="term">length</i>. In drawing, the process by which the <dfn>line
of aim</dfn> and the <i class="term">level</i> are arrived at must be associated in
<i>practice</i>, but may be <i>considered</i> separately. Advice has already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>been given to avoid&mdash;as soon as possible after the beginner has
got through the first elements&mdash;the setting-up of the bow-hand
with the arrow already on the line of aim to be then hauled
at, and this for reasons already given. But now comes in the
apparently contradictory advice, to get it planted there to be
hauled at in good time before the conclusion of the operation
of drawing, so that <i>that conclusion</i> may be certainly in the
right line of aim. And the further advice at this stage of
drawing is that the loosing-hand be kept well back, and never
allowed to advance between the archer's face and the object
aimed at. In previous editions of this book it was laid down
that 'the arrow shall be at least three-fourths drawn when
brought upon the [line of] aim.' But this is far from sufficient
at this point of the process. About nine-tenths of drawing
should be by that time accomplished, or the archer will be
in a still worse position for applying his strength to the loose
with advantage should there be any pause at this stage of
drawing to combine the <i class="term">level</i> with the <i class="term">line of aim</i>. Next come
the considerations whether the arrow should be held quiescent
for a short time, whilst the perfect aim is found, or whether
the entire drawing should be one continuous act from the
first moment of pulling and raising the bow to the loose.
Neither of these methods appears to have much advantage
over the other, if well executed. The former will be a little
more trying to the bow, and, if the finish be imperfect, may
lead to letting the arrow out, which is known as a <i class="term">creeping-loose</i>.
The latter may lead to an arrow being occasionally imperfectly
drawn; but the bow will have no cause of complaint, and full
advantage will always be taken of all the work that is done.</p>

<p>The method of drawing the arrow home at once, which has
still to be considered, has this point apparently in its favour&mdash;that
it ensures the arrow's being always drawn to the same
point. But it is very trying to the bow, the arms, and the
fingers, and, ending in what is called a <i class="term">dead-loose</i>, at the
best scarcely produces results commensurate with the labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
undoubtedly taken, and whenever it is imperfectly finished a
creeping-loose results.</p>

<p>Ascham, quoting Procopius, says that 'Leo, the Emperoure,
would have hys souldyers drawe quycklye in warre, for
that maketh a shaft flie a pace. In shootynge at pryckes,
hasty and quicke drawing is neyther sure nor cumlye. Therefore,
to draw easely and uniformely ... is best both for
profit and semelinesse.' The modern style of shooting the
York Round, &amp;c., is the same as used in his days to be called
shooting at pricks, and his advice as to the manner of drawing
cannot be much improved.</p>

<p>A few lines before the passage above quoted he says, 'And
one thynge commeth into my remembrance nowe, when I speake
of drawynge, that I never red of other kynde of shootynge,
than drawing wyth a mans hand either to the breste or eare.'
This he says when referring to the invention of cross-bows.
But it is curious that to no writer on the subject of archery
it occurred that 'under the eye' might possibly be a better
direction for 'drawing' than either to the <i>breste</i> or to the <i>eare</i>.
Yet so it is that until the first appearance of Mr. H. A. Ford's
'Theory and Practice of Archery' in 1855 there existed no
intermediate styles between the one, that was too low, and
the other, which, though in the opposite extreme, was then so
highly regarded as the grand old English style, that the
author, though annually Champion since 1849, must have been
a bold man to give the first indication of the new, and now
almost universally admitted, best style for target-practice of
drawing '<i>to such a distance that the wrist of the right hand come
to about the level of the chin</i>,' and the level of the arrow shall
be a shade lower than that of the chin; its nock being in the
vertical line dropped from the right eye.</p>

<p>One of the main features of good <i class="term">drawing</i> is that the
distance pulled be precisely the same every time; that is to
say, the same length of the arrow must be drawn identically,
whether this length be to the pile, or any shorter distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Unless this be unerringly accomplished with every shot the
<i class="term">length</i> must be more or less uncertain, since the power taken
out of the bow will be greater or less according to the longer
or shorter draw.</p>

<p>A great many devices have been tried and practised to
make this exact similarity in the distance drawn a matter of
certainty, such as by notching the end of the arrow, so that
the left hand may feel it when the right length of draw has
been reached; or by touching some point of the face, neck, or
chin, collar, button, or other fixed point with some part of the
drawing hand. But it will be found infinitely better to arrive
at an exact repetition of the same action by careful practice
rather than by dodges, which may, however, be useful as experiments.
These mechanical devices are unlikely to have a
beneficial result when constantly in use, as, when the eye and
mind are fixed and concentrated (as they should be) on the
aim, if anything occurs to distract either, the loose is almost
sure to become unequal.</p>

<p>The pile of the arrow should not be drawn on to the bow.
It is far better that no arrow be drawn further than exactly to
the pile; and every arrow should be longer, by at least as much
as the pile, than the archer's actual draw. The danger of
overdrawing, in that the arrow at the loose gets set inside
the bow, to its own certain destruction and to the bow's and
the archer's infinite risk, is very considerable. Nothing can
be gained by the violation of this rule. In cases where a
beginner may be likely to overdraw, a string of the correct
length to be drawn may be tied between the bow string and
the handle of the bow, which will effectually prevent such an
occurrence.</p>

<p>It is believed that all archers, good, bad, and indifferent, are
(more or less) constantly subject to one failing, namely, that in
completing the draw, after the aim is taken, a slightly different
line to that occupied by the arrow (if correctly aimed) is taken,
instead of making the line of finish (as they should do) an exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
continuation of the arrow's axis, dropping the right hand, or
letting it incline to the right, or both; the effect being to cast
the arrow out of the direction it had indicated, and by means
of which the aim had been calculated. Here nothing but the
most minute attention and constant practice will save the
archer; but he must be prepared for participation in this
common failing, and it is one of which he will be often quite
unconscious, though the cause of his frequently missing the
target. The very best archer needs to bear constantly in
mind the necessary avoidance of this fault; for, however skilful
he may be, however experienced and practised a shot, he may
be quite sure that it is one into which he will be constantly in
danger of falling. Failure in wind is frequently caused more
by this failing than by the effect of the wind itself; for instance,
the aim, perhaps, is designedly taken so as to make some
allowance for a side-wind, and then the loose is delivered as
if no allowance had been made. The difficulty all experience
in shooting correctly on a ground where the distant level is
not horizontal is more or less connected with this dangerous
failing. Here, though the archer be perfectly aware that the
distance slopes, however slightly, one way or the other to
the correct horizon, yet at the instant of the loose he will
unconsciously overlook this, and expect to have his unfortunate
arrow travel in a plane vertical to the mock horizon
instead of in a really vertical plane such as it must travel in,
unless diverted from it by wind. Another way of accounting for
this universal failing is that there is an unconscious detection of
error at the last moment, and a convulsive attempt to correct
this error before the completion of the loose by altering the
line of the loose. Every archer is strongly advised, when he
detects an error in the aim at the last moment that cannot be
corrected before the discharge except in the action of the loose,
to take down his arrow and begin the shooting of it afresh.
The capacity to do this, when needful, is an excellent test of
nerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
As far as possible the right hand must always be drawn
identically to the same point for all kinds of target-practice,
whatever the distance to be shot may be. To the left arm
alone should be left the delicate task of the elevation or depression
necessary when a longer or a shorter distance from the
target is adopted. It will be obvious that when the left hand
is, according to this rule, higher or lower for the purpose of
shooting a longer or shorter distance the relative positions of
the two hands must vary from a greater to a less divergence
from an horizontal level between them, and this leads to a
most important consideration in the action of drawing, namely,
the position of the right elbow. This, being necessarily out
of the archer's sight whilst aiming, is too frequently forgotten,
and a faulty weak position of the elbow is much more easily
contracted than cured. Treated as a mechanical contrivance
for drawing up an arrow, the only correct position of the right
elbow with reference to the arrow is that the arrow's axis
should pass through the point of the bent elbow, and in this
position only can the archer apply his full strength. Yet, probably
from the fact that the elbow must pass through positions
of less advantage in the course of drawing before the full draw is
reached, it will be observed that many archers at the loose
have the elbow below the level of the arrow's axis; and not a
few have the elbow projecting forwards from the same axis.
These faults are believed to be the causes of the constant and
otherwise unaccountable, but most frequent, downfall of successful
archers, generally attributed to the failure of nerve.
Yet the nerves cannot certainly be altogether at fault, for the
same archer, whose arrow takes its flight into its own hands,
when applied to target practice, can steadily draw and hold
the same arrow when it is not to be shot. It can doubtless be
observed that in such cases the arrow in the one case is drawn
up with a faulty wavering of the elbow, whilst in the other
the elbow is brought steadily into correct position. When a
position of the elbow higher than the axis of the arrow comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to be considered, it appears to partake of the nature of an
exaggerated virtue rather than a fault; is an assistance in
the earlier processes of drawing; and, when in excess though
not graceful, will probably cure itself. Much the same may be
said of the much less frequent fault of drawing the right elbow
into a position further back than the axis of the arrow. This
can only be brought about by overdrawing, and is seldom
observable except in beginners who are anxious 'to do all they
know' with too long an arrow.</p>

<p>The treatment of the elbow of the bow-arm remains to
be considered. Here trouble is more likely to arise with beginners
than in an archer's after-career. If a beginner, in
obedience to the instructions of Waring and the older masters
of the craft, hold out the bow-arm 'as straight as possible' i.e.
locked tight at the elbow, a sprain difficult to cure may not
unlikely be the result, and, at any rate, a vast deal of unnecessary
arm or armguard thrashing. On the other hand, a
bent bow-arm, such as may appear to be recommended in the
earlier editions of this work, will lead to but poor results if
a bow equal to the archer's power be used. Here again the
best advice that can be given is to hit off the happy mean
between the too rigid arm and that which is too slack. Let
the bow-arm be straightened naturally as the strain of the
loosing hand is applied to it, and by careful drill each archer
will arrive at a method of rendering the recoil of the bow
string harmless to the course of the arrow as well as to a
naked wrist, which, it is now almost universally admitted,
need not be brought into contact with the armguard.</p>

<p>A marked variation of the method of drawing has occasionally
been adopted, with considerable success, with weapons
of light calibre. The nocked arrow is placed horizontally a
little below the shoulder-level. The draw then commences
with the extension of the bow-arm, whilst the right hand and
elbow take the position for loosing, the arrow being kept all
the time on the line of aim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
One not altogether uncommon distortion must be mentioned
for careful avoidance. This consists of a stiffening of
the right wrist, with the hand bent backwards, at the time the
fingers are applied to the bowstring. This antic of course
cripples considerably the draw. The action of the wrist should
be quite free and unconstrained until the commencement of the
draw, and during the draw the back of the hand should be
kept as nearly as possible in the same line as the forearm.</p>

<p>The left shoulder requires most careful attention. It must
not be allowed to rise too high when the bow is drawn, nor to
shrink inwards, as it will sometimes do with beginners when
using bows that are too strong. Moreover, this shoulder must
be kept so close to the line between the bow and the right
shoulder that it shall project neither before nor behind that
line.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER IX.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>AIMING</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The <i class="term">aim</i> is undoubtedly the most abstruse and scientific
point connected with the practice of archery. It is at the same
time the most difficult to teach and the most difficult to learn;
and yet, of all points, it is the most necessary to be taught.
Upon the acquisition of a correct method of aiming depends
all permanently successful practice; yet respecting this important
point the most sublime ignorance prevails amongst
the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Unless the archer acquires a perfect understanding of the
science of aiming, an almost impassable barrier is presented to
his progressing a single step beyond the commonest mediocrity,
whilst his interest in his practice is increased tenfold as soon
as he has discovered that hitting or missing the object he aims
at may be removed from the mysterious condition of an unaccountable
sympathy between the hand and eye to the safer
ground of positive knowledge.</p>

<p>It is perhaps quite natural that most beginners should
assume that at any rate as regards the application of their
eyes to the shooting of arrows they can have nothing to
learn. Have they not had the full and constant use of their
eyes from their earliest infancy? and have not these been with
sufficient frequency applied in such a manner as must secure
the necessary qualifications for such a simple task as aiming
with bows and arrows? There cannot, surely, be any science
wanted in the use of weapons that any child can not only use
but even make? Was it ever necessary to take lessons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
order to secure accuracy in throwing stones? or can any
amount of abstract study of optics contribute the smallest
improvement or finish to a bowler? So it is in this matter
of aiming that beginners, and still more those who are more
advanced in practice, seem most to resent interference and
advice; partly because they object to being told that they are
making a wrong or incomplete use of their own eyes&mdash;looking
upon it as a direct accusation of folly&mdash;when they feel that
they must surely know better than their adviser all about those
useful members, which, though almost constantly in employ,
have never given any trouble, and have never even seemed to
require any training or education; and partly with the more
advanced, who have met with considerable success in hitting
with their purblind (as it may be called) method of aiming,
because they fear to weaken their not wholly complete <i>faith</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
in their own system by admitting even the possibility of a
better. Thus in this matter of aiming it will be better that the
inexperienced archer should be referred to written instruction;
and whilst on the subject of instruction it should be thoroughly
well enforced that nothing is more unpleasant than the unsolicited
interference and advice of the officious busybody, and&mdash;particularly
at an archery meeting&mdash;no unasked advice or
instruction should ever be offered.</p>

<p>It need now be no matter of surprise that before the first
appearance of this work, in 1855, no writer on archery had
been able to grapple intelligently with the subject of aiming.
When firearms first took the place of bows and arrows as
weapons of war and the chase, the firearms themselves were so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>inaccurate that chance went almost, if not quite, as far as
science in the use of them. Their improvement was but slow
and gradual; and for the firing of them the invention of percussion
instead of flint and steel, which in its turn had displaced
the original fuse, belongs to quite modern times. The
neglected bows and arrows naturally gained no improvement;
yet, until the invention of rifling firearms, bows and arrows,
except for the greater inherent difficulty in the use of them,
might have had a better chance to hold their own against Brown
Bess and the bullet (it was commonly believed that it cost the
expenditure of about a ton of lead to kill a single enemy in
battle) had aiming with them been well understood. It cannot
be doubted that many an archer (besides those who converted
their knuckles into pincushions, and resorted to other dodges)
must have hit upon an intelligent method of aiming for himself
in early times; but such early experts must have resorted to the
expedient of getting the arrow under the eye by pulling low,
and would have to bear the withering scorn of all their brethren,
who blindly upheld that the grand old English style of aiming
from the ear was alone worthy of a man; and such despised
experts would be most likely to keep their better knowledge to
themselves for the same selfish but valid reason that Kentfield
the inventor of the side-stroke in billiards, kept his own counsel
as long as he could; and also because any crusade having
as its object the deposition of the pull to the ear in favour of
the pull to the breast must always have proved quixotic. So
it came about that Mr. H. A. Ford was the first who, after
five or six years of successful practice and many diligent and
careful experiments conducted in combination with Mr. J.
Bramhall, braved the danger of being anathematised as a heretic
for daring to impugn the dear old legend of the 'pull to the
ear,' and preached in favour of a style of shooting that
brought the arrow as directly under the archer's eye as is the
barrel of a rifle in the hands of a marksman, without resorting
to the justly condemned style of pulling as low as the breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Much about the same time great improvements were
effected in firearms, which brought the accuracy of rifles much
closer to perfection. The Volunteer movement, followed by
the establishment of the annual Wimbledon rifle meeting, at
which a Ross (then an illustrious name) was the first Queen's
Prizeman in 1860, brought the scientific practice of aiming
to a pitch of perfection that had never previously been dreamed
of. Thus it will be seen that archery was not behind firearms
in scientific advancement.</p>

<p>It is stated in 'Scloppetaria'&mdash;a scarce book on the rifle,
published by Colonel Beaufoy in 1812&mdash;that 'as the deflection
from the original line of flight was an inconvenience from
which arrows were not found so liable as bodies projected from
firearms, it naturally led to an inquiry how that could arise.
The prominent feature of an arrow's flight is to spin with considerable
velocity all the time of its flight, and therefore attention
was directed towards attaining the same advantage for
firearms'; and it is not without interest to notice that the
modern rifle is thus directly derived from the clothyard shaft.</p>

<p>The improvement of the conical bullet is a later offspring
of the same ancient missile.</p>

<p>An archer holds an intermediate position between a sportsman,
who, in his attacks upon moving game, must waste no
time in taking aim, and a rifleman, who, even in a standing
position, can use the utmost deliberation. If he be as quick
as the sportsman he will increase the difficulty of reproducing
with each discharge exactly the same accuracy of pull and position.
He must not be too hesitatingly slow, or he will spoil
his bows and involve himself in unnecessary toil. Further,
the rifleman has plenty of leisure to close the eye with which
he does not aim; and such closing assists, and in no way
hinders, his taking his aim, by bringing the bead at the end of
his weapon and the mechanical sight by which the 'length'
(distance from the target) is compassed to bear upon the
centre of the target, or such other point at some trifling distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from it as the conditions of wind or weather may command;
whilst the sportsman, whose weapon cannot be sighted
for all the different distances at which the game he fires at may
be from himself, must keep both eyes open, so that he may be
better able to calculate distances and attend to such other
surrounding circumstances as with the then more perfect indirect
vision <a id="typo1" name="typo1">he</a> will be able to do, taking in a much wider field
than can be obtained when one eye only is open.</p>

<p>In the cases of the comparatively few archers who have
but one eye, or where, from the natural but not unfrequent
difference in the two eyes, one only is habitually used in
aiming, the following considerations of binocular vision can
have but an abstract interest. The binocular difficulties,
moreover, will not occur to those archers who have acquired
the habit of closing one eye whilst aiming. But the habitual
closing of the non-aiming eye is not recommended, for the
reason that any archer in full use of both eyes can much
more readily and clearly watch the flight of his arrow towards
the mark with both eyes open. There is as much enjoyment
to be obtained by following the course of a well-shot arrow as
there is necessity for watching the errors of those that fly
amiss that the causes of such errors may if possible be
avoided.</p>

<p>But before the demonstration of the true and only scientific
mode of aiming can be proceeded with, a few words must be
said on the subject of <i class="term">direct</i> and <i class="term">indirect vision</i>.</p>

<p>When both eyes are directed upon the observation of any
single object&mdash;say the centre of the gold of the target at 100
yards&mdash;the axes of the eyes meet at that point, and all parts
of the eyes having perfect correspondence as regards that
point, the sensation of perfect vision is given, i.e. the best and
most accurate image that can be obtained on the retinæ of
the point to which the entire attention of both eyes is directed.
But at the same time there are images formed on the retinæ,
of other objects nearer (those more distant need not be considered)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
than this point, and to the right and left of it, as well
as above and below it; and all such objects are included within
the attention of indirect vision. The exact correspondence of
the images formed on the two retinæ applies only to the point
of direct vision, and the images of all other objects&mdash;i.e. the
objects of indirect vision&mdash;are differently portrayed on each
retina. Any object embraced in this indirect vision will be
seen less or more distinctly according to its remoteness or
otherwise from one or other of the axes in any part of its
length; and it will be, or at any rate naturally should be,
clearest to the indirect vision of that eye to the axis of which
it most approximates.</p>

<p>Now, in aiming with an arrow, to arrive at anything like
certainty, it is necessary to have in view three things, namely,
the mark to be hit (the gold of the target); the arrow, as
far as possible in its whole line and length (otherwise its
real future course cannot be appreciated); and the point of
aim.</p>

<p>It may be well to explain here that by the <i class="term">point of aim</i> is
meant the spot which the point of the arrow appears to cover.
This spot, with the bow, is seldom identical with the centre of
the gold, or if it be so with any individual archer at one particular
distance, it will not be so at other distances, because
the arrow has no adjusting sights such as are provided to
assist the aim with a rifle. As an example, let it be supposed
that an archer is shooting in a side-wind, say at 80 yards,
and that this distance is to him that particular one where, in
calm weather, the point of his arrow and the gold are identical
for the purposes of aiming. It is clear that, if he <i>now</i> treat
them so, the effect of the wind will carry his arrow to the
right or left of the mark according to the side from which
it blows. He is therefore obliged to aim on one side of his
mark, and the point of his arrow consequently covers a spot
other than the target's centre. And this other spot in this
instance is to him his <i class="term">point of aim</i>. Under the parallel circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of a long range and a side-wind the rifle will be
found subject to the same rule.</p>

<p>Now it will be understood that it is necessary for the
archer to embrace within his vision the gold, the point of
aim, and the true line in which the arrow is directed.</p>

<p><i class="term">Direct vision</i> can only be applied to one object at a time,
and as direct vision should be applied as little as possible
to the arrow during the aim, it has to be shown in what way
the arrow must be held in order that the archer may, by
means of his <i class="term">indirect vision</i>, clearly appreciate the <i class="term">true line</i> in
which it points at the time of aiming. The discussion as to
whether the gold or the point of aim shall be the object of
direct vision may be postponed for the present.</p>

<p>Now it may be positively asserted as an incontrovertible
axiom in archery that this true line cannot be correctly
appreciated by the shooter unless the arrow lie, in its whole
length, directly beneath the axis of the aiming eye. This is
most confidently maintained, in spite of the fact that the
strongest, the most deliberate, and the most successful archer
of the present day systematically keeps his arrow a trifle outside
his right eye. It must be remembered that Ascham
ordains that '<i>good mennes faultes are not to be followed</i>.'</p>

<p>The indirect vision of both eyes can never be used here,
for if it were, according to the law of optics, two arrows would
be seen; but this is never the case with the habitual shooter&mdash;though
both his eyes be open, habit, and the wonderful
adapting power of the eye, preventing such an untoward
effect equally well as (nay, better than) if the second eye be
closed. To state this more correctly: an expert archer with
both eyes open is in the same condition with two similar eyes
as a person who, with imperfect sight, habitually wears a
spy-glass to improve the sight of the one eye, with which
improved eye alone he sees, to the complete neglect of all that
is taken in by the other eye, though constantly open. Those
who have shot both right- and left-handed&mdash;and there are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a few such&mdash;can answer for it that, though a different indirect
vision of the arrow is observed with each eye, either can at
will be used without any inconvenience arising from the unnecessary
presence of the other. Another unusual exception
may here be mentioned of a style of aiming which, though
eminently successful through a good many years in the case
of a Championess, cannot be recommended for imitation.</p>

<p>She kept her direct vision only on the point of her arrow,
thus seeing the nock end of the arrow gradually diverging from
its point towards each eye by indirect vision, and also by indirect
vision seeing two targets, or two sets of targets, from which she
had to select the correct one to secure the right direction for
the loose. Many archers close the non-aiming eye, and it will
be well for all beginners to do so to avoid a very possible
trouble, in the case of an archer whose non-aiming eye is the
best and most used of the two, of this better eye officiously
interfering to do wrong what its neighbour only can do right.</p>

<p>But to return to the statement that the arrow in its whole
length must lie directly beneath the axis of the aiming eye,
which is now assumed to be the right eye, as it is so in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred. From fig. 40 it will appear that
it must be so, because otherwise the shooter will be deceived
as to the true line it has to take; for so long as the point of
the arrow touches the axis of the aiming eye, the arrow may
appear to that eye to be pointing in a straight line to the
object looked at, though really directed far away to the right
or left of it, as shown in fig. 41; where the arrow <span class="smcap small">CB</span>, though
really pointing in the directions <i>b</i><span class="smcap small">CE</span>, may, through touching
the axis of the eye from <span class="smcap small">B</span> to <span class="smcap small">D</span> at <span class="smcap small">C</span>, falsely appear to the
archer to be aimed at the object <span class="smcap small">D</span>.</p>

<p>(In figs. 40 to 43 the distances between <span class="smcap small">A</span> and <span class="smcap small">B</span> are supposed
to represent the possible two inches or so between the
two eyes, and the distances between <span class="smcap small">A</span> and <span class="smcap small">D</span> and <span class="smcap small">B</span> and <span class="smcap small">D</span> to
be not less than fifty yards.)</p>

For instance: suppose the archer to be shooting at such a
distance that his point of aim is included in the gold; he of
course will bring the point of his arrow to bear upon it, just as
a rifleman would his sights; that is, the point will touch the
axis of the aiming eye. But if the arrow itself be inclined, say
to the right of the axis (as in the pull to the ear it would be),
it will fly away some distance to the left of the object looked at.
And the converse of this will be true also; for if it incline to the
left of the axis it will then fly off to the right; the archer in
these cases being in the position of a marksman who instead
of keeping his foresight in a line with his backsight has deliberately
adjusted the aperture of his backsight to the right or
left of the bead at the muzzle of his weapon with reference to
the object aimed at.</p>

<p>An example that came within Mr. Ford's personal knowledge
will afford a perfect illustration, and will be useful for
the possible solution of similar cases. An archer had shot
for many years, but invariably found that if ever his arrow
pointed (as it seemed to him) in a straight line with the centre
of the target it persistently flew off to the left of it five or
six yards, even at the short distances (see fig. 43, where the
arrow <span class="smcap small">BC</span>, though pointing in the direction <span class="smcap small">BE</span>, appeared
to the shooter to be aimed at <span class="smcap small">D</span>). He was therefore obliged
to make an allowance and to point his arrow that much to
the right (see fig. 42, where the arrow <span class="smcap small">BC</span>, though pointed
straight to <span class="smcap small">D</span>, appeared to the archer to be pointing in the
direction <span class="smcap small">AE</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>). In vain he sought a solution of this anomaly.
All could tell him that there was something faulty; but, as
everything in his style and mode of action appeared correct,
that something remained a mystery, until it was ultimately
discovered that, though the arrow was held directly beneath
the axis of the <i>right</i> eye (this being also open), this archer
actually used his <i>left</i> eye to aim with. It will be readily
seen why the discrepancy existed between his aim and the
flight of his arrow, the fact being that the arrow did not
appear to the shooter to be pointing towards the object at <span class="smcap small">D</span>
until it touched the axis of his left eye, and consequently
not until its direction pointed far away to the left of the
mark (see fig. 43). On closing the left eye the direction of
the arrow's flight and the aim coincided, because the eye beneath
whose axis the arrow lay became the eye with which
the aim was taken.</p>

<p>As to whether the <i class="term">direct</i> vision should be applied to the
mark to be hit or to the <i class="term">point of aim</i>, the argument is all in
favour of the latter. For the point of aim must of necessity
be in relation to the mark&mdash;either in the same vertical line
with it or outside that line. If outside, then the direct vision
must certainly be upon the point of aim; otherwise the arrow
cannot lie directly beneath the axis of the aiming eye, which
has already been shown to be necessary. Therefore the only
question remaining to be decided is, When the <i class="term">mark</i> falls in
the same vertical line with the <i class="term">point of aim</i>, which of the two
should be <i>directly</i> looked at? Here again an argument can
be adduced to determine the choice in favour of the latter;
for when the point of aim is above the mark the latter will
be hidden from the right or aiming eye by the necessary raising
of the left or bow hand, as may be easily proved by the
closing of the left eye; therefore the direct vision cannot be
applied to the mark, though it may be applied to the point
of aim. There now remains but one case, namely, when the
point of aim falls below the mark, but in the same vertical
line with it; and here (though either of them may in this
case be regarded with the direct vision) as no reasoning or
argument can be adduced for violating or departing from
the rule shown to be necessary in the other cases; and as
it is easier to view the point of aim directly and the mark
indirectly than the contrary, because the point of aim will
necessarily lie between the mark and the arrow's axis; and
as uniformity of practice is highly desirable, the application
of direct vision to the point of aim in every case is most
strongly recommended. This teaching was quite contrary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that taught by all the old-fashioned writers, who maintained
that the eye, or eyes, should be kept always intently fixed
upon the mark to be hit. It is probable that even those
archers who imagine that they regard directly the mark
only, do so only in the case when the mark and the point
of aim coincide (which with each archer may be called his
<i class="term">point-blank</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> range); and this is analogous to all rifle practice,
where from any cause allowance must be made.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that all these remarks apply
only to target lengths. As regards aiming at very long distances,
when the mark and the point of aim are too far apart
to be sufficiently seen in conjunction, no scientific principle
can be laid down for the guidance of an archer. Practice
alone will give him a knowledge of the power of his bow,
and the angle of elevation required to throw up the arrow
as far as the mark. If the distance to be shot be a known
and a fixed one-for instance, two hundred yards&mdash;the necessary
calculations are more or less attainable; but the great
distance renders the result so uncertain as to prevent anything
approaching to the accuracy of aim attainable at the
customary target distances. If the mark be a varying and
uncertain one, as in Roving, the archer is entirely dependent
upon his judgment of distances. This sort of shooting,
though very interesting, must be attended with a great
amount of uncertainty; but, as in every other case, the more
judicious practice be applied the greater will be the success.</p>

<p>No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down for deciding where
the point of aim ought to be at any particular distance, as
this is dependent upon a great variety of circumstances&mdash;as
strength of bows, and the sharpness and dulness of their
cast, heavy or light arrows, a quick or sluggish loose, and
the varying force of different winds. One archer will find
his point-blank range at 120 yards, whilst another can get a
point-blank aim on the target, at 60 yards even, by raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>his loosing hand so high that the angle between the axis
of his aiming eye and the axis of the arrow is very small.
It is now many years ago since two toxophilites, using bows
of about fifty pounds in weight, with five-shilling arrows of
the old-fashioned manner of feathering, and employing the
same position (about three inches below the chin) of the
right hand for the loose at each of the three usual distances
of 100, 80, and 60 yards, found that the point of aim at
100 yards was about the target's diameter (4 feet) above the
target, whilst the point of aim at 80 yards was about the same
measure below the target, and the point of aim at 60 yards
was at a spot about fifteen paces from the shooter.</p>

<p>It would have been highly interesting if Mr. H. A. Ford,
who was always most faithful to his own dogma that the
loosing hand must be brought to the same position at the
loose, had published some account of his own points of aim,
which must have had a very wide range of variation from
those of his best period, when he was using 56 lb. bows,
and arrows 29 inches in length, up to the time of his last
appearance as Champion, in 1867 at Brighton, when, with weak
bows and light arrows, his score was 1,037, with 215 hits.</p>

<p>The late ingenious Mr. James Spedding, who always touched
some button on his coat-collar with his loosing hand, contrived
a '<i class="term">sight</i>' upon his bow, which obviated the necessity of
a point of aim. This was a bright metal bead such as is at
the muzzle of a gun. This at the upper end of a slight metal
rod (in fact, a bright-headed pin), and fitted into a groove
added to the back of the bow (in which it could at will be
lowered or raised), gave him a point of aim on the centre of
the target at distances where his natural (may it be called?)
point of aim would have been beneath the target. With this
contrivance, the slightest variation in the slope of the bow
distorted the aim.</p>

<p>The American contrivance of the <i class="term">peep-sight</i> is a very
minute instrument, with a still smaller aperture. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shifted up and down the bowstring, and, when correctly
adjusted, the aiming eye should just catch sight of the centre
of the target through the aperture. This instrument is confessedly
useless except for very weak bows, and the smallest
trembling even would put it off the aim, and blind, as it
were, the aiming eye.</p>

<p>An Irish shot, the late Captain Whitla, succeeded in
getting his aim on the target at all the three distances by
varying the strength and cast of his bows, using his best and
strongest at 100 yards, then one that was slower and weaker
at 80 yards, and trusting himself to a slug like a broomstick
at 60 yards.</p>

<p>Another archer (with the same bow at all distances) got
his aim upon the target when shooting at 100 yards by
touching with the thumb of his right hand about the position
of the right collar-bone. When shooting at 80 yards he got
his aim again on the target by raising his hand so high that
his thumb, now coiled up and close to the root of the first
finger, with its top joint touched beneath the chin. And at
60 yards he still obtained an aim on the target by raising the
loosing hand higher, so that the same point of the thumb
touched the right corner of his mouth. It is believed that in
this case the gradual contraction of the angle between the
axis of the eye and of the arrow led to a shorter draw at the
nearer distances.</p>

<p>One class of archers, though implied in previous discussions,
should also be treated separately, as they may be more
in number than is generally supposed, namely, those who,
because the left eye is the best of the two, or, from constant
and incurable habit, aim with the left eye, though shooting,
as it is called, right-handed, i.e. holding the bow in the left
hand. Such archers should, if the peculiarity be detected in
time, be recommended to shoot with the bow in the right
hand. Possibly more than one most promising archer has
been kept on the top rung but one of the ladder of fame by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
trying to force his weaker right eye to do the work that
might have been much better done by the left one. It has
also been already explained that, where physical peculiarities
admit it, this right-handed shooting with the left eye gives
the archer a slight mechanical advantage, as the divergence
from the line of force may be thus contracted.</p>

<p>To conclude the subject of aiming, it is not pretended that
shutting one eye and aiming with the other is wrong, but
that it is better, though occasionally closing one eye for experiments,
to use the other eye for aiming with, the one being
diligently trained to keep in the background, attending solely
to its own subordinate functions.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER X.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF HOLDING AND LOOSING</i></span></h2>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">Holding.</h3>

<p>By <i class="term">holding</i> is meant keeping the arrow fully drawn before
it is loosed. Ascham has made this his fourth point of archery;
and but little can be added to what he has said on the subject.
'Holding,' he says, 'must not be longe, for it bothe putteth a
bowe in ieopardy, and also marreth a man's shoote; it must be
so lytle yat it may be perceyued better in a man's mynde
when it is done, than scene with a man's eyes when it is in
doyng.' This represents so exactly what holding, at its best,
should be, that it needs only be added that this almost imperceptible
pause before the act of loosing serves to steady the
arm and perfect the aim, and is a great assistance to the
obtaining of a certain and even loose. It is therefore, in company
with the other points of archery, most necessary to be
cultivated if successful hitting is to be the result. But let no
archer think to arrive at this perfection of holding by grasping
his bow as tight as he possibly can from first to last. The
grasp should be gradually tightened as the strain of the draw
is increased; otherwise too much toil is given to the bow-hand,
and it will fail in the loose. One very successful shot had so
many faults that his success was always a surprise; yet he
had this invariable virtue, that, though it was obvious that
he held his bow quite loosely during the draw, at the final
pause his grasp was visibly tightened most firmly.</p>

<p>Mention should not be omitted of the sadly false conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
many archers have of holding when fully drawn. This
they exhibit by constantly letting the arrow creep out whilst
they appear to be taking aim, as though they were quite
incapable of checking its impatience to be off. This is a
most dangerous fault, and must be most carefully guarded
against.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="p2 smcap">Loosing.</h3>

<p>After the bow has been drawn up to its proper extent, and the
aim correctly taken, there still remains one more point which
the archer must achieve successfully before he can ensure the
correct and desired flight of his arrow to its mark; and this
is the point of <i class="term">loosing</i>, which term is applied to the act of
quitting or freeing the string from the fingers of the right
hand which retain it. It is the last of Ascham's famous
'Quintette,' wherein, though he does not say much, yet what
he does say is so much to the point that it may well be
quoted. 'It must be so quycke and hard yet it be wyth oute
all guides, so softe and gentle that the shafte flye not as
it were sente out of a bow case. The meane betwixt bothe,
whyche is the perfyte lowsynge, is not so hard to be folowed

haue al archers in war to haue both theyr heades pouled and
there berdes shauen, lest the heare of theyr heades should stop

<p>This loosing is the archer's crowning difficulty; for no
matter how correct and perfect may be all the rest of his performance,
the result will infallibly prove a failure, and end in
disappointment, unless the loose also be successfully mastered.
Upon this the flight of the arrow mainly depends, and to how
great an extent this may be affected by it may be gathered
from the fact that the same bow with a like weight of arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and length of pull will cast many yards further in the hands
of one man than it will in those of another, owing solely and
entirely to the different manner in which the string shall have
been quitted.</p>

<p>No arguments are necessary to prove how delicate an
operation it is in archery to loose well, and to accomplish,
with the evenness, smoothness, and unvarying similarity necessary
for accurate hitting, the consummating effort, including
as it does on the one side of an instant the greatest exertion
of muscles that on the other side of that instant are in perfect
repose. But considerable misapprehension exists amongst
archers as to what is a good loose, it being often thought
that if an extreme sharpness of flight be communicated to
the arrow, it is conclusive evidence as to the goodness of the
loose, without reference to the consideration that this extreme
sharpness of loose seldom produces steadily successful hitting
at any distance, and still less frequently is effective at all the
distances. A thoroughly good loose cannot exist unless accuracy
of hitting as well as keenness of flight be the combined
result; and if the two cannot be obtained together, a slower
flight with accuracy rises immeasurably superior to the rapid
flight with uncertainty.</p>

<p>The flight of an arrow keenly loosed is as fair to view as
that of any bird, whilst the flight of an arrow that is badly
loosed is as uninteresting as the staggerings of a drunken
man. This is quite apart from the consideration of hitting
the object aimed at; but when the question resolves itself into
this practical form&mdash;'Is it possible for the same mode of loosing
to give the utmost rapidity of flight and at the same time
certainty of line and elevation?'&mdash;the consensus of experience
should be in the negative. There is no denying that a few successive
arrows may be shot accurately in this way, but during
any prolonged period the inaccuracy of flight is sure to be
such as to render the average shooting inferior. The difficulty,
amounting almost to an impossibility, of obtaining a loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which shall combine great sharpness and accuracy of flight at
the same time arises from the fact that such a loose requires,
to obtain that sharpness, that the fingers of the right hand
be snatched away from the string with such suddenness and
rapidity as to compromise the second quality of accuracy&mdash;such
a sudden jerk of the string endangering the steadiness
of the left arm at the final moment, and, by its unavoidable
irregularity, not only having a tendency to drag the string
and consequently the arrow out of the proper line of flight,
but also simultaneously to vary the elevation. Excepting for
long-distance shooting, then, a very sharp loose cannot be
recommended; nevertheless, in case he may be at any time
engaged therein, the archer perfect at all points should have
it under his command.</p>

<p>The different looses may now be divided into the <i class="term">slashing</i>
loose, which may degenerate into the snatch or may be improved
into the steady <i class="term">continuous</i> loose. The chief contrast
to this is the <i class="term">dead</i> loose, which in strong hands is very useful.
This consists of the simple opening of the fingers for the
escape of the string, and is liable to degenerate into the
<i class="term">creeping</i> loose, which need not be further referred to except
for the purpose of again urging its avoidance. Another loose,
which may be called an <i class="term">active</i> loose, is an appreciable improvement
upon the dead loose in that the fingers at the
loosing instant are withdrawn from the string, though without
any further draw, and will be found, after the escape of the
string, to have resumed their previous position&mdash;i.e. curled
up instead of being sprawled out straight as is the case in
the dead loose. The only remaining loose may be called the
<i class="term">lively</i> loose, and consists of a short and quick additional draw,
after the aim has been taken, of say from half an inch to
three inches, and finished with an <i class="term">active</i> loose, and care
must be taken to prevent the degeneration of this into a
snatch.</p>

<p>Before the final treatment of the loose be entered upon, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
will be useful to consider how the different sorts of shooting-gloves
and finger-tips affect this intricate operation. Doubtless
in the times when the English archer was in such high
repute in battle, the only loose suitable to the old glove was
the <i class="term">slash</i>, as the only method of quitting the string, which,
with the strongest bow each individual could use, must, for
the longest pull on such bow, have been gripped as close as
possible to the inside of the knuckles of the last joints of the
two or three fingers used. No other loose could be employed
with any chance of obtaining full results from the work done,
and it is evident from the Acts of Parliament on the subject
that in the archer's drill none but long-distance shooting was
countenanced. The comparatively modern finger-tips or thimbles
connected by straps at the back of the hand and buckled
on round the wrist must have been used with the same slashing
sort of loose. But, with the old tab made of horse-butt
leather, and all the different neatly-fitting tips with catches
that have been invented long since the commencement of
the public meetings at which York Rounds are shot, a much
steadier and quieter loose may be obtained without wasting
any of the work done; but, it must be admitted, with the
general result that there is some slight decrease in the average
strength of the bows that are used now. Moreover, it has
been found that in the closely-contested matches of the present
times the slashing sort of loose stands at a positive disadvantage
at the shorter ranges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
  <img src="images/i-128.jpg" width="447" height="400" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 46.</span>
</div>

<p>With the glove and tab and tips without catches the best
loose may be obtained with the fingers extended as far as
is compatible with the retention of the string; and, by applying
the fingers almost diagonally to the string, a very firm grip
is secured combined with much facility of liberation (fig. 46,
p. 128). With the help of catches on the tips the string can be
taught to rest at any intermediate point on the last joint or
third phalanx of either of the fingers&mdash;it will be found more
convenient here to use the word <i class="term">phalanx</i> for each part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
finger, each finger having three phalanges, first, second, and
third&mdash;and the most entirely different hold on the string to the
one previously described is that where the fingers are almost
completely curled up (fig. 45); with an <i class="term">active</i> or <i class="term">lively</i> loose the
string may be very sharply quitted with this hold, but it is
more liable to strain the fingers, unless the bow be weak,
and the high-set catch, though more popular twenty years
ago, is now very little used. With a strong common glove
and all four fingers on the string, this extreme position has
been known to contribute to first-rate scores at all the distances,
and it is probably the necessary position when four
fingers are used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
  <img src="images/i-127a.jpg" width="385" height="400" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 45.</span>
</div>

<p>The intermediate position between these two extremes will
probably be found the best, and this may be thus described.</p>

<p>The third phalanx of the middle finger should be as nearly
as possible at right angles with the line of the drawn-up arrow.</p>

<p>The second phalanx will make an obtuse angle with the
third, and the first about the same obtuse angle with the
second; and these obtuse angles will vary in individual
instances according to the stiffness or suppleness of the finger-joints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The back of the hand will incline slightly away from the
line through the forearm, so that the line from the elbow
through the wrist may be quite straight with the same line
continued through the wrist to the position of the string on
the fingers at <span class="smcap small">A</span>. The positions of the phalanges of the first
and third fingers will vary from those of the second finger, as
shown in fig. 44.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 227px;">
  <img src="images/i-127.jpg" width="227" height="400" alt="" /><br />
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 44.</span>
</div>

<p>This position of the string across the fingers should be
neither too near to nor too far from the tips, as too great a
grip necessitates a drag or a jerk to free the fingers, besides
exposing more surface to the friction of the string in passing
over it; whilst an insufficient hold of the string weakens the
shooter's command over it, and renders the giving way of the
finger a constant occurrence. It is therefore recommended
that the string be placed as nearly as possible midway between
the tips and first joints of the fingers.</p>

<p>Now a good loose may be described as possessing the
characteristic that the fingers do not go forward one hair's
breadth with the string, but their action is, as it were, a continuance
of the draw rather than an independent movement,
yet accompanied with just enough additional muscular action
in a direction away from the bow and simultaneous expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the last joints of the fingers at the final instant of quitting
the string as to admit of its instantaneous freedom from all
and each of them at the same identical moment of time; for
should one finger linger on the string but the minutest
moment longer than its fellows, or should all or any of them
follow forward with the string in the slightest degree, the loose
will be faulty and the shot a probable failure. So slight,
however, is this muscular movement that, though a distinct
and appreciable fact to the mind of the shooter, it is hardly if
at all perceptible to the lookers-on, as in a good loose the
fingers should instantly recover their holding position, but
will be at a slight though appreciable distance further from the
bow consequent upon the combined effect of the removal of the
pulling weight of the bow and the loosing effort. A passage
out of Mr. Townsend's article, 'How should the String be
Loosed,' in the 'Archer's Register for 1866-7,' may here be
quoted. 'The string of the bow having been pulled to the
fullest extent intended, and the pause having been felt or
made, next comes the loose; and, as this <i>must be effected by an
opening of the fingers</i>, the tendency of the string would be to
run forward, if ever so little, during the opening; and, as the
whole spring [cast] of the bow is not given to the string
[and arrow] until it is altogether freed from the fingers, so,
to prevent [the] loss of power, the pulling hand and arm
are drawn so much further back, as the opening of the fingers
would allow the string to run forward before it is altogether
released. Thus the string in reality remains stationary or
nearly so [quite so] during the loose; and the fingers are
freed without going one hair's breadth forward with the string.'</p>

<p>As an assistance towards this instantaneous recovery of
the loosing fingers, some archers wore silver rings round the
first phalanges of their three fingers, and these rings were
connected by india-rubber straps with the finger-tips, thus
compelling the first and third phalanges to approximate, as
described in the <i>Mason</i> tips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Mr. Townsend's 'india-rubber practising apparatus' has not
been seen for many years, though of great assistance in experiments
and in correcting faults and general improvement
of drawing and loosing.</p>

<p>Some archers use only the first and second fingers, and the
loose thus obtained possesses the advantage that the string
when quitting the fingers has less surface in contact with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford's own latest loose was from the first and third
fingers, with the second finger packed upon the back of the
first finger for its support; and he has been heard to declare
that this arrangement of the fingers gives the best loose
possible, as already described.</p>

<p>One of the commonest faults at the present day is the
habit of making the third finger do more than its fair share
of work. Evidence of this failing may be found in the fact
that blisters are far more common on the third finger than on
either of the others, and a frequent result is that the muscles
of the third finger get strained and even partially torn from
their attachments. This is one of the most frequent causes
of the breakdown of archers who practise much. This may be
avoided and the loose much improved by turning the backs of
the fingers while drawing slightly upwards, and inwards, and
thus exerting more pressure with the forefinger. An example
of what is meant may be seen in the <a href="#fisher">picture</a> (opp. p. 122) of
Major Fisher, whose loose is remarkably good. Here it will
be seen that the line of the knuckles is not perpendicular, but
slopes outwards and downwards from the knuckle of the forefinger
to that of the fourth.</p>

<p>The utility of catches on the finger-tips has already been
explained in a previous chapter, but may be further mentioned
in connection with the loose as contributing by an invariable
hold on the string to a constant repetition of exactly the same
loose.</p>

<p>Especial care must be taken that, whilst loosing, the left
arm must maintain its position firmly and unwaveringly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
must not give way at the final moment in the slightest degree
in the direction towards the right hand, as arrows constantly
dropping short are the certain consequence of any such
shrinking of the bow-arm&mdash;the same injurious effect being
produced on their flight as when the fingers of the right hand
are allowed to go forward with the string. This yielding of
the left arm is of more constant occurrence than archers will
generally admit, and is the cause of many an arrow, otherwise
correctly treated, missing its mark. This failing is not
unfrequently the result of too much practice. All must be
firm to the last, and the attention of the shooter should never
be relaxed for a single instant until the arrow has actually left
the bow. But, though this firmness be necessary for the
shooting of an arrow it is not necessary, however satisfactory
the result or good the attitude, to remain for some seconds
in rivalry with the Apollo Belvedere; the bow-arm should, if
possible, be instantly and quietly moved to the left whilst the
next arrow is procured from the quiver or whilst the shooting
station is given up to the next in order; and this leftward
motion of the left arm will correct the very general tendency
there is to throw the upper horn of the bow to the right and
downwards convulsively, which is a very frequent and unsightly
antic. Many of the other objectionable antics already referred
to are brought to perfection at this instant, and should also
be most carefully avoided.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER XI.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>OF DISTANCE SHOOTING, AND DIFFERENT ROUNDS</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">The attention may now be turned to the results obtained by
the use of the bow and arrow.</p>

<p>The best notion of the old practice of archery may be
gained from a review of the ancient butts or shooting-fields
of our ancestors. These shooting-grounds were evidently
attached to every town (if not also village) in the kingdom, as
may be gathered from the universal survival of the local name
of Butts. There is extant 'A plan of all the marks belonging to
the Honourable Artillery Company in the fields near Finsbury,
with the true distance as they stood, Anno 1737, for the use
of long-bows, cross-bows, hand guns, and artillery.' These
marks all have different appellations, and there is but one
single instance of a repetition of the same distance between
one of these marks and the other.</p>

<p>The ground on which these marks were situated appears to
extend from a mark called <i class="term">Castle</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> to <i>Islington Common</i>, and
there were two sets of actual butts at the Islington end. The
distance between the one pair of these butts is given as six
score and ten yards&mdash;i.e. 130 yards. The distance between
the other pair is not given in the plan, but it appears to be
less than half of the other, and is probably about sixty yards.
The whole length of these shooting-fields appears to be about
one mile on the plan; and this is about the actual distance
between the Artillery Ground and the 'Angel,' Islington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The longest distance between any of the two marks is thirteen
score and five yards&mdash;i.e. 265 yards&mdash;between Turk's Whale
and Absoly. Here follow the names of the marks; and these
may possibly be still traced in the neighbourhood in some
instances. The distances are also given.</p>

<p>The start is made from 'Castle.'</p>

<p>The sum of all these distances amounts to about 4-1/2 miles,
being actually 4 miles and 804 yards. There is a pathway
extending the whole distance from Blood House Bridge to
Islington Common. There are boggy places set down as
lying between Turk's Whale and Absoly, and Turk's Whale
and Day's Deed. There is also a bog located between the two
nearest butts, which must have been inconvenient; also a
pond on one side, and another bog on the other side of them.</p>

<p>Two other measurements are given&mdash;namely, fifteen score
and eight yards, or 308 yards, for the length of a garden wall
lying some yards to the right of the White Hall and Pitfield
marks; and sixteen score and two yards, or 322 yards, in the
same neighbourhood, close by the pathway, and indicating
about the distance between Star or Dial and Edw. Gold.</p>

<p>The widest part of these shooting-fields seems to be at
about this same part&mdash;viz. from White Hall to Scarlet
242 yards, and on to Jehu 82 yards, a total width of 324<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
yards; and the narrowest part extends from Nevil's House to
Islington Common, in which narrow part are both the sets
of butts.</p>

<p>There appear to be some eight or ten fields included in
the plan, with hedges indicated, but there is no appearance of
either a road or a pathway crossing them.</p>

<p>These marks, giving a great variety of distances, from the
shortest of 73 yards between Turk's Whale and Lambeth to
the longest of 265 already particularised, seem admirably
calculated for the training of the old English archer and the
teaching him readily to calculate the various distances at any
time between himself and his enemy; and it is worthy of
observation that all these distances are well within the belief
of modern archers as such distances as&mdash;bearing in mind that
there is no evidence of general deterioration&mdash;our ancestors
could easily compass, seeing that there are well-authenticated
instances of lengths somewhat beyond 300 yards having been
attained in modern times without any lengthened special
training.</p>

<p>In these fields no doubt was seen the <i class="term">clout shooting</i>, which
is still kept up by the Woodmen of Arden, at Meriden in Warwickshire,
and by the archers of the Scottish Bodyguard at
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>This style of shooting is so called from the aim having
been taken at any white mark (cloth, etc.), placed at a fixed
distance; but the clout in use now is a white target with a
black centre, set slantwise on the ground. The distances vary
from 180 to 240 yards, and this latter distance may be
taken as about the extreme range of this style of shooting in
olden times; as Shakespeare mentions (2 Henry IV. iii. 2)
that 'old Double,' who 'drew a good bow,' and 'shot a fine
shoot,' 'would have clapped i' the clout at twelve score, and
carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half,
that it would have done a man's heart good to see.' As the
clout is but rarely hit, the arrow nearest to it at each end, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
within three bows' lengths (about eighteen feet) of it, counts
as in bowls and quoits.</p>

<p>When the Grand National Archery Meeting was held at
Edinburgh in 1850, some of this shooting was introduced,
with the result that, out of 2,268 shots at 180 yards, there
were 10 hits, and out of 888 shots at 200 yards there were
5 hits.</p>

<p>At the meetings at Meriden stands a marker right in front
of this clout, whose duty it is to signal back to each archer,
when he has shot, whether his arrow fall short, or go too far,
or wide, and&mdash;to avoid being hit himself.</p>

<p>The ordinary target arrows may be used in this practice
up to the distance of 200 yards, but beyond this distance much
stronger bows or flight arrows must be employed.</p>

<p>In these fields, too, would be kept up the practice of <i class="term">roving</i>,
or taking, as the object to be aimed at, not these or any
known mark, but some stray or accidental mark. This practice
must have been valuable in olden times in testing the
knowledge of distances acquired at the different fixed marks,
and it would still be interesting as an amusement, but it is
not now so easy to find grounds sufficiently open for the purpose.
Where there is sufficient space for golf links, roving might
still be practised, and already the golfer's ball and the archer's
arrow have been matched together between hole and hole.</p>

<p>Of <i class="term">flight-shooting</i>, or shooting with <i class="term">flight</i> or light arrows, it
may be said that such practice was probably in vogue in old
times for the purpose of annoying the enemy whilst at a distance,
or in such a ruse as is described by Hall in his account of
the battle of Towton in 1461, when 'The Lord Fawconbridge,
which led the forward of King Edwardes battail, beinge a man of
great Polyce, and of much experience in Marciall feates, caused
every archer under his standard to shoot one flight (which
before he caused them to provyde), and then made them to
stand still. The Northern men, felyng the shoot, but by
reason of the snow not wel vewyng the distaunce betwene them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and their enemies, like hardy men shot their schefe arrowes as
fast as they might, but al their shot was lost and their labor
vayn, for thei came not nere the Southern men by xl. tailors'
yerdes.'</p>

<p>Flight-shooting has also been used in experiments to determine
the extreme casts of different weights and kinds of bows,
and the greatest range attainable by the power and skill of
individual archers. As a result of such experiments, it may
be stated that very few archers can cover more, or even as
much as, 300 yards. To attain this range, a bow of at least
sixty-two or sixty-three pounds must not only be used but
thoroughly mastered, not merely as regards the drawing, but
in respect of quickness and sharpness of loose also.</p>

<p>The only remaining style of shooting in vogue in old times&mdash;that
at the butts or mounds of earth&mdash;was known as <i class="term">prick-shooting</i>,
a small mark being fixed upon the butt and shot at
from various distances. This style of shooting was probably
popular even then, as many of the Acts of Parliament are
levelled against it, on account of its interfering with the more
robust practice of the long distances necessary for the purpose
of war. This prick-shooting next became known as the <dfn>paper
game</dfn>, when cardboard, and paper stretched on canvas, were
placed on the butts. It is not very clear when such targets as
are now in use came into fashion, with their gaudy heraldic
faces. The distances employed for this butt-shooting appear
to have been differently calculated from the lengths in the
longer-distance shooting, an obsolete measure of 7-1/2 yards,
known as an <i class="term">archer's rood</i>, having been employed; and the
butt-shooting in vogue at the revival of archery in 1781 was
at the distances of 4, 8, 12, and 16 roods, or 30, 60, 90,
and 120 yards; and the modern distances of 60 yards, 80
yards, and 100 yards do not seem to have come into use until
they were mentioned towards the end of the last century as
<i class="term">Princes' lengths</i> at the annual contests held in the grounds
of the Royal Toxophilite Society, for the possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
silver bugles presented by their patron, George IV., then
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>About the date of the Introduction of the <i class="term">York Round</i> in
1844, two other rounds were in use amongst archers and in
archery clubs. These were the <i class="term">St. Leonard's Round</i>, which
first consisted of 75 arrows at 60 yards only, but afterwards
of 36 arrows at 80 yards, and 39 arrows at 60 yards; and the
<i class="term">St. George's Round</i>, consisting of 36 arrows at each of the
distances of 100 yards, 80 yards, and 60 yards, the round of
the St. George's Archers, who occupied grounds in St. John's
Wood, near London.</p>

<p>The <i class="term">York Round</i>, having been now firmly established for
more than forty years as the round appointed to be shot at
all the public archery meetings, has become the acknowledged
test of excellence in bow practice, and all other rounds have
dropped out of use with the exception of the round known as
the <i class="term">National Round</i>, which is practised by ladies at the public
meetings, and consists of 48 arrows at 60 yards and 24 arrows
at 50 yards; and of 48 arrows at 80 yards and 24 arrows at
60 yards, as practised by gentlemen at meetings where the
100 yards shooting is omitted.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER XII.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>ARCHERY SOCIETIES, 'RECORDS,' ETC.</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">Prince Arthur, the elder brother of King Henry VIII., enjoys
the reputation of having been an expert archer, and it is
believed that in his honour a good shot was named after him;
but as he was born in 1486 and died in 1502, his skill in the
craft cannot have had time to arrive at maturity, though even
in modern times a stripling has occasionally snatched the
palm of success from the more mature experts.</p>

<p>That King Henry VIII. took a deep interest in archery
as necessary for the safety and glory of his kingdom is quite
certain, and the various Acts of Parliament passed in the
course of his reign (3 Henry VIII. ch. 3, 4, 13; 6 Henry VIII.
ch. 2, 11, 13; 14 &amp; 15 Henry VIII. ch. 7; 25 Henry VIII.
ch. 17; and 33 Henry VIII. 6 &amp; 9) sufficiently prove his
determination to stimulate the more frequent use of the long
bow. But, apart from his public encouragement of archery,
he took personal interest in it himself, and, being a famous
athlete, he was no doubt as successful with his bow as his
natural impatience would allow. The following extracts from
the accounts of his privy purse for the year 1531, when he
was forty-one years of age, may be taken as the nearest
approach to his actual scores that can be reached. The late
Lord Dudley's score at 60 yards, when shooting with one
of the best shots at that distance, at one guinea per arrow,
must have shown an equally unfavourable <span class="locked">balance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'20 March.&mdash;Paied to George Coton for vij shottes loste by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

<p>And again on the last day of June there were 'paied to the
iii Cotons for three settes which the King had lost to them
in Greenwich Park xx<i>l.</i> and vj<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i> more to one of them
for one up shotte.'</p>

<p>This George Coton (Cotton) is probably the same person
who was governor to the Duke of Richmond, the King's
natural son.</p>

<p>On January 31, 1531, 'paied to Byrde Yoeman of the
Kinges bowes for making the Roundes at Totehill by the
Kinges commandment xij<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i>'</p>

<p>The musters, or what we should now call reviews, were at
this time held in the Tothill Fields.</p>

<p>Sir W. Cavendish, the historian of Cardinal Wolsey, thus
speaks of his interview with the King in 1530, when he was
the bearer of the news of the death<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> of Wolsey to the King,
then staying at Hampton Court. (See Cavendish's 'Wolsey,'
1827, p. 396.)</p>

<p>'Upon the morrow (of St. Nicholas Eve, 1530) I was
sent for by the King to come to his grace; and being in
Master Kingston's chamber in the Court (Hampton Court),
had knowledge thereof, and repairing to the King, found him
shooting at the rounds in the park, on the backside of the
garden.</p>

<p>'And perceiving him occupied in shooting, thought it not
my duty to trouble him: but leaned to a tree, intending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
stand there, and to attend his gracious pleasure. Being in a
great study, at last the King came suddenly behind me, where
I stood, and clapped his hand upon my shoulder; and, when
I perceived him, I fell upon my knee. To whom he said,
calling me by name, "I will," quoth he, "make an end of my
game, and then will I talk with you," and so he departed to
his mark, whereat the game was ended.</p>

<p>'Then the King delivered his bow unto the yeoman of
his bows, and went his way inward to the palace, whom I
followed.'</p>

<p>Sir Thos. Elyot, the first edition of whose book, the
'Governour,' was printed in 1531, devoted chapter xxvii. to
the praise of the long bow, and was the earliest writer on the
subject of archery, unless the unknown author of the 'Book
of King Modus,' which is said by Hansard ('Book of
Archery,' 1840, p. 210) to be 'preserved in the royal library at
Paris,' wrote about two centuries and a half before the 'Toxophilus,'
by Roger Ascham, was printed in 1545.</p>

<p>Neither Elyot nor Ascham makes any mention of the
societies of archers known as the Fraternities of St. George
and of Prince Arthur, but something of the kind is plainly
indicated by Richard Mulcaster in his book, the 'Positions,'
published in 1581, where he quaintly says, 'This exercise'
(archery) 'I do like best generally of any rounde stirring without
the dores, upon the causes before alleaged: which, if I
did not that worthy man our late learned countriman Maister
Askam, would be halfe angrie with me though he were of
milde disposition, who both for the trayning of the Archer to
his bowe and the scholler to his booke, hath showed himselfe
a cunning archer and a skilful maister.</p>

<p>'In the middest of so many earnest matters I may be
allowed to intermingle one which hath a relice of mirthe: for
in praysing of Archerie as a principall exercise to the preseruing
of health how can I but prayse them who profess
it thoroughly and maintain it nobly, the friendly and franke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fellowship of Prince Arthur's knights in and about the Citie
of London which of late yeares have so reuiued the exercise,
so countenaunced the artificers, so inflamed emulation, as in
themselues for friendly meting, in workmen for good gayning,
in companies for earnest comparing, it is almost growne to
an orderly discipline, to cherishe louing society, to enriche
labouring pouerty, to maintaine honest actiuitie, which their
so encouraging the under trauellours, and so increasing the
healthfull traine, if I had sacred to silence would not my good
friend in the Citie, Maister Heugh Offley, and the same my
noble fellow in that order, Syr Launcelot, at our next meeting
haue giuen me a sowre nodde, being the chief furtherer of
the fact, which I commend, and the famousest knight of
the fellowship, which I am of? Nay, would not even Prince
Arthur himself, Maister Thomas Smith, and the whole table
of those wel known knights, and most actiue Archers haue
layd in their challeng against their fellow knight, if, speaking
of their pastime, I should haue spared their names? Whereunto
I am easily led bycause the exercise deseruing suche
prayse, they that loue so prayseworthy a thing, neither can
themselues, neither ought at my hande to be hudled up in
silence.'</p>

<p>In 'the Auncient order Societie and unitie laudable of
Prince Arthure and his Knightly Armory of the Round Table
London, 1583,' Richard Robinson says, 'King Henry VIII.
not onely ... proceeded with what his Father had begun,'
by keeping up a body guard of archers, 'but also added
greater dignity ... by his gracious charter confirmed unto
the worshipful citizens (of London) ... this your now
famous Order of Knights of Prince Arthure's Round Table or
Society.'</p>

<p>But when the practice of archery was enforced by Act of
Parliament, and there were shooting butts and fields at hand
almost everywhere for the use of those who took a genuine
interest in the exercise, there could be but little reason for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
introduction of archery societies and clubs. The meetings for
the exhibition of skill would be the regular musters.</p>

<p>How different the position of archery would have been if,
instead of clamouring for and getting passed irksome Acts
of Parliament, compelling all to shoot, archers, bowmakers,
fletchers and others had started a National Long-Bow Association
with State sanction and encouragement for the promotion
of this exercise and the reward of the most successful shots!</p>

<p>As in early times there were great musters or reviews of
companies of archers, of whom the sole actual survivor is the
Royal Body-Guard of Scotland (the Archers Company of the
Honourable Artillery Company, itself originally a body of
archers, was revived late in the last century, and is now
represented by the Royal Toxophilite Society) for military display;
and local festivities, and wardmotes, as still maintained
by the Woodmen of Arden (revived in 1785) and the Scorton
Arrow Meetings (dating back to 1673), for the glorification of
the best local shots; and the daily use of the long-bow for
exercise and sport, i.e. killing of game; so now there are the
meetings of the Grand National Archery Society, established
for the peaceable purpose of annually rewarding the champion
and championess and other illustrious archers, as hereafter
set out in the full account of these meetings, and also the
local public meetings of similar character also given; and in
addition to these there are the meetings of the numerous
archery societies and clubs in different localities, and the
constant private practice either at home or on club grounds.</p>

<p>Nothing is now to be gained by insisting upon the marked
inferiority of the 'incomparable archers' who flourished towards
the close of the eighteenth and in the first half of the present
centuries, as compared with the many strong and accurate
shots who have displayed their skill since the establishment
of the Grand National Archery Meetings. Mr. H. A. Ford
seems to have been unable to find any records of shooting at
100 yards where more than one-half of the shots were hits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
though he says (p. 112), 'I have seen a letter as late as 1845,
from good old Mr. Roberts' (the author of the 'English
Bowman,' 1801), 'who was well acquainted with the powers of
all the best archers of the preceding half-century, in which he
states "he never knew but one man that could accomplish
it."' This one man was probably Mr. Augustus L. Marsh,
Royal Toxophilite Society, who owned, and was able to use, the
magnificent self-yew bow of 85 lbs. now in the possession of
Mr. Buchanan, of 215 Piccadilly, as may be seen from the
following records of his best scores in <span class="locked">1837:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These would be considered even respectable performances
now when hits in the <i class="term">petticoat</i> count, and all hits between the
colours count in that of higher value, also when three arrows
are shot consecutively, instead of two separately, at each end.
Competitive examinations had not then been brought to their
more recent perfection, and standards of excellence in athletics
were as yet unrecorded. Professor John Wilson's ('Christopher
North') wonderful long jump remained as unsurpassable
as the 'Douglas cast,' unless it were, perhaps, beaten
or preceded by the deeds of the wondrous athlete who could
clear a full-sized billiard-table lengthwise, though in his first
attempt to do so he failed through knocking the back of his
head against the far side of the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Townsend, in 1865, made the best 'record'
of shooting at 100 yards, at a wardmote of the Woodmen of
Arden, when all the old customs just referred to were still, as
now, in vogue, his score being 322 from 80 hits out of 150
shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
There is now left for consideration the subject of 'record,'
or standard of highest excellence at the public meetings, and
it appears that Mr. A. P. Moore's performance at Derby in
1849 of 747, when, however, Mr. H. A. Ford became champion
by the points, was the earliest notable score. Mr. H. A. Ford
improved upon this in the next year at Edinburgh by scoring
899, and in 1854, at Shrewsbury, he made an advance to 1,074.
In 1857, at Cheltenham, he took the record on to 1,251 score
with 245 hits, and there it now remains.</p>

<p>The first eminent score by a championess was 634, made
by Miss H. Chetwynd at Cheltenham, also in 1857. Mrs.
Horniblow took the record on to 660 at Worcester in 1862,
Miss Betham next advanced it, at the Alexandra Park Meeting
in 1864, to 693. At Bath, in 1870, Mrs. Horniblow took it
further to 700, and also still further to 764, with 142 hits,
in 1873 at Leamington, and at that point it now remains,
though very closely approached by Miss Legh's score of 763
at Sutton Coldfield in 1881.</p>

<p>Miss Legh's still better score of 840, with all the 144 hits,
was made at the Grand Western Meeting at Bath in 1881;
and Mrs. Piers F. Legh outstripped this 'record' by scoring
864 with 142 hits at the Leamington and Midland meeting in
1885; 33 of the hits on this occasion were golds.</p>

<p>The best 'record' of target practice at 120 yards is to be
found amongst the doings of the Royal Toxophilites. Mr.
H. O'H. Moore, in 1872, on the Norton prize-day, shooting
144 arrows, scored 213 with 43 hits, and Mr. G. E. S. Fryer,
on the similar occasion in 1873, scored 273 with 67 hits.</p>

<p>In the shooting at 100 yards of the same society, on the
Crunden day in 1854, shooting 144 arrows, Mr. H. A. Ford
scored 362 with 88 hits. This score remained unbeaten,
though surpassed in hits by Mr. G. E. S. Fryer in 1873 (361
score, 91 hits), until it was fairly outstripped by Mr. C. E.
Nesham, who scored 478 with 104 hits in 1883. He also made
435 score with 95 hits in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
In 1866 Mr. T. Dawson, Royal Toxophilite Society, presented
a challenge medal for the reward of excellence in shooting
at 80 yards, 144 arrows being shot, and in the first year
this medal was taken by Mr. T. Boulton with 501 score from
113 hits. This record he took on further in 1875, with 591
score from 125 hits. This has been nearly approached only by
Mr. C. E. Nesham in 1886, with 576 score from 124 hits.</p>

<p>The record for the 60 yards (144 arrows being shot) medal,
presented by the same gentleman in 1866, was also started
in that same year by Mr. T. Boulton, with 824 score from
142 hits. This record was surpassed by Mr. W. Rimington in
1872, his score being 840 from the same number of hits.</p>

<p>A good record for best shooting at 100 yards at the annual
West Berks meeting, when 216 arrows are shot at that distance,
was first reached by Major C. H. Fisher in 1871, when he
made 140 hits with 556 score. In 1877 he carried the record
on to 572 score with 136 hits. Mr. C. H. Everett made a still
further advance with 155 hits and 633 score in 1880; and in
1881 Mr. H. H. Palairet made 153 with 623 score.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Butt (then Miss S. Dawson) still belongs the
best 'record' for the 'Ladies' Day' of the Royal Toxophilite
Society, the largest annual gathering of ladies, when the single
National Round of 48 arrows at 60 and 24 arrows at 50 yards
is shot. She made 70 hits with 406 score in 1867; in 1875
she scored 401 with 69 hits; and in 1885 Mrs. P. F. Legh
made 70 hits with 400 score.</p>

<h2><span class="subhead">CHAPTER XIII.</span><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>THE PUBLIC ARCHERY MEETINGS AND THE DOUBLE
YORK AND OTHER ROUNDS.</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2">In 1791, ten years after the revival of archery by the establishment
of the Royal Toxophilite Society, a public meeting
of all the Archery Societies, which had already become very
numerous in the United Kingdom, was held on Blackheath,
and this meeting was followed by other similar meetings in
1792 and 1793. Here ended this series of National Archery
Meetings, and in the early part of the present century the use
of the bow appears to have languished.</p>

<p>The records of the Scorton Arrow Meetings go back, in
an almost uninterrupted succession of annual meetings, to the
year 1673. These meetings, though originally confined to a
limited locality&mdash;'six miles from Eriholme-upon-Tees,' near
Richmond, in Yorkshire&mdash;were open to all comers. In 1842
and 1843 these meetings were held at Thirsk, in Yorkshire,
and to those present thereat the establishment of an annual
Grand National Archery Meeting is certainly owing.</p>

<p>The first Grand National Archery Meeting was held at
York on August 1 and 2, 1844, the Scorton Arrow Meeting
having been again held at Thirsk on July 30 in the same
year. It was originally intended that the meeting should
occupy one day only, but the weather proved so unfavourable
on the first day that the Round had to be finished on the
second day. To the enterprising archers of Yorkshire is also
due the invention of the York Round, which has since become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the almost universally acknowledged test of the comparative
excellence of all archers. This Round&mdash;which is now always
shot on each of the two days of a public archery meeting&mdash;consisting
of six dozen arrows at 100 yards, four dozen arrows
at 80 yards, and two dozen arrows at 60 yards, was so
arranged in the belief that about the same scores would
then be made at each distance; and this has been proved
tolerably correct as regards the average of archers, though
not so as regards Mr. H. A. Ford, Major C. H. Fisher,
Mr. H. H. Palairet, Mr. C. E. Nesham, and some others, when
shooting in their best form, as it would be clearly impossible
for them to score, in four dozen arrows at 60 yards, the 495
which Mr. H. A. Ford made in twelve dozen arrows at 100
yards at Cheltenham in 1857, or the 466 which he made on
the same occasion in eight dozen arrows at 80 yards. Efforts
have occasionally been made to reduce the quantity of shooting
at 100 yards, for the benefit of those who look upon 80
yards as a long distance; and it has also been suggested that
a few arrows might be taken from 80 yards and added to 60
yards; but it is generally acknowledged that the York Round
cannot well be mended.</p>

<p>The Ladies' National Round of four dozen arrows at 60
yards, and two dozen arrows at 50 yards, shot on each of two
days, did not become the established Round until 1851, and
then the only reason of its adoption was that it corresponded
in quantities with the shooting of the gentlemen at 80 yards
and 60 yards.</p>

<p>In the year after the Third Leamington Grand National
Archery Meeting&mdash;i.e. in 1854&mdash;the Leamington Meeting was
started, and has ever since been an annual institution, except
in those years when the Grand National Meeting has been
again held at Leamington.</p>

<p>The first Crystal Palace Archery Meeting was held in
1859, and has since been repeated annually.</p>

<p>The Grand Western Archery Meeting was started at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Taunton in 1861, and has been repeated annually at different
places, except in 1865, when the Grand National Meeting
was held at Clifton, and in 1867, when no Grand Western
Archery Meeting was held. In 1886 this meeting was combined
with the Grand National Archery Meeting when held at
Bath.</p>

<p>Occasionally an extra public meeting has occurred&mdash;as at
Aston Park, Birmingham, in 1858 and in 1868; at the Alexandra
Park, Muswell Hill, in 1863, and again in 1873 and
1882; also at Hastings, in 1867.</p>

<p>The first of a series of Grand Northern Meetings was
established in 1879. This meeting has since been repeated
annually.</p>

<p>In 1881 the Royal Toxophilite Society, in celebration of
their centenary, gave a Double York Round meeting, which,
though not strictly speaking a public meeting, was so well
attended that it cannot be omitted from the records of the
York Round. This meeting has also been repeated annually
ever since 1881.</p>

<p>Almost the largest attendance of gentlemen at a public
Archery Meeting consisted of one hundred and ten at York
in 1845, when there were only eleven ladies shooting. At
Cheltenham, in 1856, there were seventy-two ladies and one
hundred and twelve gentlemen shooting. The best attended
meeting was in 1860, at Bath, when there were one hundred
and nine gentlemen and ninety-nine ladies. This was just
before the beginning of the Grand Western Meetings, and
there was a full meeting of ninety gentlemen and ninety-three
ladies in 1865, in which year no Grand Western Meeting
was held.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Seventh Grand National
Archery Meeting, which was held in Edinburgh in 1850,
all the Grand National Archery Meetings have occurred in
England.</p>

<p>Two Double York Round Scottish National Meetings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
held in Scotland in the years 1865 and 1866; but they were
not largely attended.</p>

<p>In Ireland, in the course of the years 1862 to 1866, Irish
National and other public meetings were held, mostly in
the grounds of the Dublin Exhibition; but though the Double
York Round was shot, and some good shooting was done
by the Irish and also by English visitors, the meetings were
mostly small, and there seems but little probability of their
revival.</p>

<p>A few words should be said about the scoring at public
meetings. The original plan was for the Captain at each
target to mark, with a pricker made on purpose, the hits
made by each shooter in a space representing each of the
colours of the target&mdash;gold, red, blue, black, and white. In
1872 an improved plan was adopted of keeping a proper space
for the hits made at each end, in which is entered each hit in
the figure representing its value, as 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. When
no hit is made at any end, this fact should also be recorded;
and thus the progress of the shooting is always kept accurately
noted, and the possibility of mistakes in the scores is very
much diminished.</p>

<p>Mr. H. A. Ford often mentions the St. George and St.
Leonard's Rounds&mdash;the former being three dozen arrows at
each of the distances of 100, 80, and 60 yards, and the latter
(originally 75 arrows at 60 yards only) being three dozen
arrows at 80 yards, and three dozen and three at 60 yards.
The practice of these Rounds has now entirely disappeared
from amongst archers.</p>

<p>During the whole of the period from 1844 to 1886 inclusive
the appointed Round has been completed (except at the Leamington
Meeting in 1862, when the weather rendered it quite
impossible); and this says a great deal for the steadfastness of
archers, as they have frequently had to submit to the ill-treatment
of pitiless downpourings of rain and arrow-breaking
storms of wind in order to get the Round finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
No approach has been made to Mr. H. A. Ford's best
public score of 1,251, made at Cheltenham in 1857, or to his
second best record of 1,162 at Leamington in 1856; but his
other scores of over 1,000 are easily counted&mdash;namely, 1,076
at Exeter in 1858, 1,014 at Leamington in 1861, 1,037 at
Brighton in 1867, 1,087 at Leamington in 1868, and 1,032
at Leamington in 1869. Major C. H. Fisher made 1,060 at
Sherborne in 1872. Mr. Palairet made 1,025 at the Crystal
Palace in 1882, and 1,062 in the Regent's Park in 1881. Mr.
C. E. Nesham made 1,010 in the Regent's Park in 1883, and
1022 at Bath in 1886. No other archers have reached 1,000
at a public match.</p>

<p>Miss Legh's score at Bath in 1881 of 840, when she made
all the 144 hits, stood foremost amongst ladies' achievements
until it was beaten by Mrs. Legh's score of 864 with 142 hits
at Leamington in 1885. Miss Legh in 1882, at the Crystal
Palace, scored 792, and in 1885 809 with 143 hits. Mrs.
Butt's score of 785 at Leamington in 1870 ranks next.
Then come Mrs. Horniblow's scores of 768 at Leamington
in 1871, and of 764&mdash;also at Leamington&mdash;in 1872. Mrs.
Piers F. Legh scored 763 at Sutton Coldfield in 1881.
Mrs. V. Forbes scored 752 at the Crystal Palace in 1870.
Mrs. Marshall scored 744 at the Crystal Palace in 1884.
Miss Betham's best score was 743 at Leamington in 1867.
Mrs. P. Pinckney scored 729 at the Crystal Palace in 1873;
and Mrs. Pond scored 700 in 1874, also at the Crystal
Palace. No other ladies appear to have made as much as
700.</p>

<p>When attention is turned towards the meetings at which
most gentlemen have made more than 600, and most ladies
have made over 500, it is found that in 1860, at Bath, seventeen
gentlemen reached or passed the score of 600, but at
the same time only two ladies passed 500. This still remains
the largest meeting which has yet been held, two
hundred and eight shooters having been present. At the
Alexandra Park Meeting in 1864, sixteen gentlemen and six
ladies attained the same amount of excellence. At Brighton,
in 1867, seventeen gentlemen and seven ladies passed the
same levels. But, in 1882, at the Crystal Palace, the corresponding
numbers were ten gentlemen and nineteen ladies,
and at Leamington in the same year, fourteen gentlemen and
sixteen ladies; whilst in 1883, at Cheltenham, nineteen gentlemen
passed 600 and fourteen ladies passed 500, though the
shooters competing at this meeting were only one hundred and
thirty-one. At Windsor in 1884, thirteen ladies scored more
than 500, and twelve gentlemen more than 600. This shows
clearly that, although the number of attendances has diminished
since the extraordinary start given to archery by Mr.
H. A. Ford's book (and this is possibly due to the multiplication
of public matches), yet the average of excellence,
particularly amongst the ladies, has made considerable progress.
This is a most encouraging symptom for the future of
archery.</p>

<p>This match had a most exciting finale. When the last
three arrows alone remained to be shot, Mr. Bramhall was 2
points ahead in score. It was then a simple question of nerve,
and Mr. Ford's proved the best, as he scored 14 to his opponent's
2. The two gentlemen were placed at adjoining targets,
and Mr. Bramhall's nerve was further disturbed by his hearing
some one noisily offer to bet heavily in favour of Mr. Ford.
Mr. Ford shot first at his target, and Mr. Bramhall second at
his.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford's score on July 9, in the handicap match,
amounted to 485.</p>

medal, and made the finest score ever yet made in public.</p>

<p>The average of the shooting of all showed a marked improvement
at this meeting; and it was gratifying to Mr. Ford
to be able to state that several of the leading archers attributed
their high positions in the prize-list to their careful
following out of the principles and directions laid down in his
book.</p>

<p>Sixty-one ladies and ninety-seven gentlemen shot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horniblow won the silver bracer with 4-1/2 points. Miss
Turner won the point for hits at 60 yards, Lady Edwardes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the point for score at 60 yards, and Miss H. Chetwynd won
the point for score at 50 yards and divided the point for hits
at this distance with Mrs. Horniblow.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford, having won all the ten points, became Champion
for the tenth time. He accounted for the apparent falling
off in the shooting at this meeting as compared with the
previous one by the fact that the weather was rough and the
ground difficult.</p>

<p>Eighty-four ladies and eighty-six gentlemen shot.</p>

<p>It was intended, and advertised, that this meeting should
be repeated in 1859; but, from insufficient support, it was
abandoned, and the first of the series of annual archery meetings
held in the grounds of the Crystal Palace was substituted
for it.</p>

<p>A Grand Archery Meeting, under the management of Mr.
Merridew, was proposed to be held in the grounds of Aston
Park, Birmingham, on July 27 and 28, 1859, as mentioned
by Mr. H. A. Ford at page 124; but at the Leamington
meeting of the same year it was decided that this proposed
meeting should be transferred to the grounds of the Crystal
Palace at Sydenham, and thus commenced the annual Crystal
Palace Archery Meetings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lister won the first score prize, but Mrs. Atkinson
won the silver bracer with 4 points.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lister won 2 points for gross score.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horniblow won the point for score at 50 yards, and
Mrs. Litchfield won the point for hits at 50 yards.</p>

<p>At this meeting Mr. Edwards won the Champion's medal
with 6 points, Mr. Ford, who took third rank, having won 4
points&mdash;namely, 2 for gross hits and those for hits at 80 yards
and hits at 60 yards.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine ladies and 109 gentlemen shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
The influence of hits as affecting the position of the winners
of the best prizes was now entirely abandoned, and the order
of the prizes taken from the gross score only, except when two
had a tie in score. In this case the difference (if any) in hits
was considered.</p>

<p>Want of space prevents the introduction of all the winners
of best prizes, who vary in number at the different meetings
from six to twelve, according to the numbers present; but it
should be mentioned that at the earliest meetings the second
prize was allotted to the maker of most gross hits. This
rule prevailed up to 1851. In 1852, 1853, and 1854 the
order of prize-winners was in accordance with the order of
the gross scores. From that date the first prizes were named
'first, second, third, &amp;c. gross score, and hits,' and the rule by
which the order of the prize list was obtained was that the
number of each shooter's position in hits was taken and added
to the number representing his position in score. The lowest
total won the first score and hits prize, and the next lowest
the second, and so on. In cases where the totals of two
were the same, the highest score would win. The application
of this rule may be observed in 1859, when Mr. Richardson
made the third score (812), but won the fourth prize;
whilst Mr. Edmondstone, who made the fourth score, won the
third prize. Mr. Edmondstone was second in hits and fourth
in score (total, 6); Mr. Richardson was third in score and
fourth in hits (total, 7).</p>

<p>Mr. H. A. Ford became the Champion for the twelfth and
last time. He won 8 points, Mr. E. A. Holmes having won
the point for score at 100 yards, and Mr. O. K. Prescot that
for score at 80 yards. Mr. E. A. Holmes was unwell during
the shooting at 60 yards on the second day, when he made
only 89 at that distance. The average value of the first ten

the highest average ever yet attained. Mr. H. A. Ford on this
occasion was using very weak bows, not much more than forty
pounds in weight, and light arrows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horniblow won the silver bracer with the highest
score, as there was a tie between her and Mrs. Kinahan in
points. This was said to be the case at the time, but it does
not appear to have been so from the published scores, as
Mrs. Horniblow had the advantage by one-half a point. Mrs.
Horniblow appears to have won 2 points for gross score, 1
point for a tie with Mrs. Kinahan for total hits, and one-half
a point for a tie with Mrs. E. Lister for hits at 50 yards&mdash;total,
3-1/2 points. Mrs. Kinahan won 2 points for hits and
score at 60 yards, and 1 point for the tie in total hits&mdash;her
total being only 3 points. Miss Betham won 1 point for score
at 50 yards. The annual report of this meeting was never
issued by the Hon. Secretary, the Rev. O. Luard, so the actual
state of the case cannot now be made certain. Of course
there may have been an error in the unofficial accounts
published.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Rimington won the Champion's gold medal with
the highest score, as there was a tie in points between him
and Captain C. H. Fisher, each having won 4 points. Mr.
W. Rimington won 1 point for score at 100 yards, 1 point
for score at 60 yards, and 2 points for gross score. Captain
C. H. Fisher won 2 points for score and hits at 80 yards,
and 2 for most total hits. Mr. E. A. Holmes won 1 point for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
hits at 60 yards, and Mr. O. K. Prescot one point for hits at
100 yards.</p>

<p>On this occasion it was decided by the Committee that in
future the Champion honours at their meetings should be
decided by gross score and not by points. A handsome silver
cup, value 50 guineas, collected by small subscriptions from
numerous archers, was presented on July 29 to Mr. C. M.
Caldecott, of Holbrooke Grange, near Rugby, who had acted
for many years as judge at these meetings.</p>

<p>Only thirty-six ladies and sixty-nine gentlemen shot at
this meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Everett's score was 471.</p>

<p>This meeting was made memorable by the retirement of
the Rev. O. Luard from the office of Hon. Secretary of the
Grand National Archery Society, after having acted as Secretary
at thirty-six meetings&mdash;in fact, at every meeting hitherto,
except the first in 1844. He was presented with a complimentary
scroll, setting out the universal appreciation of his
services, and with a purse containing 200 guineas. Mr.
Palairet was elected to succeed Mr. Luard as Hon. Secretary.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>CLUB SHOOTING AND PRIVATE PRACTICE</i></span></h2>

<p>In the following scores an attempt is made to give authentic
specimens of the best shooting of as many as possible of the
best archers of the past and present time. Mr. Ford himself
mentioned how sadly disheartened and crestfallen he felt on his
return from his first Grand National Meeting at Derby, where
he had scored 341 with 101 hits in the double York Round,
which was far below the score he had anticipated, and warned
his readers that shooting at a public meeting was very different
from private practice or small match shooting. There are but
very few archers who have not met with the same disappointment,
as will be easily seen when the public and private records
here given are compared. Young archers should be strongly
recommended to make their public <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débuts</i> as early as possible&mdash;as
well to work off the novelty and excitement of
the scene as to compare the methods and results of other
archers&mdash;before they have established great local reputations,
which may run the greater risk of being fatally exploded from
the very over-anxiety which is employed to keep or increase
those reputations in public.</p>

<p>The erroneous practice of shooting trial arrows before the
commencement of the regular round has been mostly given
up of late years, being altogether discountenanced by the
rules of the private practice club, and disallowed at all the
public meetings.</p>

<p>In fact, it was a most dangerous practice at the public
meetings, where, in former years, before the match shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
commenced, or when it was finished, those who had to cross
the ground ran no little risk of being shot by some of the
industrious archers, who, not satisfied with the round allotted
to the day, were threshing out themselves and their bows, not
with shooting at the targets, but mostly at a piece of white
paper placed about so far from themselves as an arrow would
fall when supposed to have passed through the gold at the
particular distance at which these zealots were ever engaged
in the apparently hopeless search of the 'range' or a 'point
of aim.'</p>

<p>The earliest grand score on the testified York Round in the
books of the Royal Toxophilite Society belonged to <i class="person">Mr. H. C.
Mules</i>, and was shot on August 24, 1856.</p>

<p>Mr. H. A. Ford himself reports one of his own most
extraordinary feats as follows: 'Not but what I have been the
originator of a respectable fluke or two myself in my time.
For instance, on the second day of the first Grand National
Meeting at Shrewsbury in 1854, an old archer, Mr. Hughes,
offered a silver bracer as a prize for most golds at any one end,
100 yards to take precedence of 80, and 80 yards of 60. In a
very few minutes two gentlemen, Messrs. Garnett and Hilton,
if I remember rightly, got two; but this was not enough, the
third arrow being destined to go there as well. Accordingly,
but a few rounds after, my friend Chance came to my aid,
and so the whole three went into the desired spot. Now the
combination here was curious. But once during my archery
experience has a special prize been offered for a feat of this
particular nature, and upon that occasion, and that occasion
only in a match, have three golds been got at one end, by one
shooter, at 100 yards' ('Archer's Register,' 1864).</p>

<p>Mr. Bramhall gives a good idea of Mr. Ford's indomitable
perseverance. 'If,' he says, 'I reported a good score, he persevered
until he had beaten it&mdash;e.g. in 1853, March 7, I completed
409 following hits at 60 yards. He soon sent me a report of
a little over 600' ('Archer's Register,' 1881).</p>

November 25, 1851:</p>

The full particulars of <i class="person">Mr. O. K. Prescot's</i> (Royal Toxophilite
Society) best private practice double York Round score
of 1197 cannot be given, as they have been lost or destroyed.
It was shot in two days of September 1867. The first total
score was 621, and the score at 100 yards was 256&mdash;200
having been made in the first 4 dozen. The second round was
567, and, in this round, the score at 80 yards was 249. The
most annoying thing about the round was that the last arrow
at 60 yards missed the target, when a black even would have
brought the total up to 1200.</p>

<p class="in0">On January 13, 1869, he made 3 golds in one end at 100 yards.</p>

<p><i class="person">Mr. J. A. Froude</i> (Royal Toxophilite Society) says: 'I did
once make [a score of] over 500 [in the single York Round] in
a private match; but only once, and the record of it has long
vanished. Richardson and Spedding were both shooting on
that occasion, and I, for a miracle, in that single instance
beat Richardson.' This probably happened about 1860.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the private practice of <i class="person">Mr.
G. Edwards</i> (Champion in 1860-1-2-4-6) was far beyond his
public shooting. He has been heard to say that, though Mr.
Ford had been able to land only 71 of the 72 arrows shot at
100 yards in the target (missing his 59th arrow), he (Mr.
G. E.) had put all his 72 arrows into the target at the same
distance. There is no reason to disbelieve his positive statement
that on one occasion, shooting 24 arrows at 60 yards,
he put every one of them in the red circle.</p>

<p>'Some of the scores made by <i class="person">Mr. Edward Mason</i> in private
practice were very large, and it is to be regretted that no
actual details can be given. It is well known, however, that on
several occasions he made a score of over 1000 on the double
York Round, and were the figures available they could not
fail to be of wide interest' ('Archers' Register,' 1882-3).</p>

<p><i class="person">Mr. Peter Muir</i> (Champion 1845-7 and 1863) was a most
successful shot at all distances, short as well as long, but
probably seldom, if ever, practised the York Round. Mr.
H. A. Ford gives as his best score the following, made at the

a crow (fact).</p>

<p><i class="person">Mr. E. Meyrick</i> says: 'It is true that I have seen <i class="person">Escott</i>
hurl his eight-shilling arrows from a bow of 80 lbs. and ten-shilling
arrows from a 100-lb. bow, but then he could not do
much hitting. I should think something authentic must exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of my old friend <i class="person">Marsh's</i> long shot of 360 yards up and down.
He would hit half his arrows at 100 yards very often,' as may
be seen from the extracts given from his actual scores.</p>

<p>A point of interest in <i class="person">Mr. W. Butt's</i> (Royal Toxophilite
Society) shooting is, that he shot with both hands, though
only on one occasion did he shoot two rounds on the same
day, one with each hand. This was at a West Berks meeting
at Coombe Wood, Surrey (Sir W. Baynes), as follows:</p>

<p class="in0">in private practice October 2, 1886.</p>

<p>No attempt has yet been made to collect the records of the
many excellent scores that have been made by numerous ladies
in club matches, or in private practice; but it is believed that,
owing to the ladies' shooting at the public meetings being more
like their club and private practice, in that it occupies an afternoon
only, and is not spun out all over the day, as is the case
with the gentlemen, the ladies' public shooting more fairly represents
the best they can do; yet many ladies have scored
over 400 in the half of the National Round who have not yet
approached the 800 which both Mrs. and Miss Legh have shown
to be attainable at a public meeting in the National Round.
A few samples of their accuracy of aim can however be here
given as specimens of what might be contributed to another
edition of this book.</p>

may be insincere, as he speaks of it as 'the waye of summe excellent shoters,'
and further as good 'mennes faultes.' May it not be hoped that he refers to
this as his own style when he says (see further on) 'of these faultes I have
verye manye myself,' modestly classing his own excellence as possibly faulty.
See Mulcaster, who says he (R. A.) 'hath showed himself a cunning Archer,' but
this refers to his capacity for 'trayning the Archer to his bowe.'</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3" class="ref"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> By 'drawing the arrow home' the full length of the arrow is not necessarily
intended, but so much of its length as each archer <i>should</i> draw.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4" class="ref"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a> It must have been from the absence of this complete faith that the celebrated
archer mentioned by Montaigne in his seventeenth chapter was constrained
to decline the offer made to him when condemned to die, that 'to save
his life he should exhibit some notable proof of his art; but he refused to try,
fearing lest the too great contention of his will should make him shoot wide,
and that, instead of saving his life, he should also lose the reputation he had
got of being a good marksman.' And again in the case of Tell the same
scarcity of faith became apparent from his securing in his quiver that second
quasi-historical arrow.</p>
